		"So enjoyed watching the wanderings of the Swanson men in Paris!!! Flowers looking lovely to liven things up at 2:28! So glad I'm not the only person who remembers the mantra of \"when in Europe, always look UP\" for all that meticulous ceiling beauty and craftsmanship like you did around 3:24 & 3:32. It always amazed me when traveling abroad how much detail went into all aspects of the creation of most every old monument, artifact, artifice and church/cathedral! I cannot wait to see more father son vlogs as you two roam the city, once again creating an awesome vicarious escape from reality for myself! Just make sure you guys BOTH make enough time to get some SLEEP (you know, that foreign concept you keep hearing about Jay\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude34) \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc95\u270c!"
