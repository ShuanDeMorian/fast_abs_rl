        "spend my time kind of going around the church in it through it tell you a couple fun facts about it try to keep it short but also enjoy some of the views put a little music to it and give you some fun facts and tips one big tip ",
        "make sure to come to the garden behind the church that s where i m starting today this is an area that a lot of people don t make it to for some reason and it s gorgeous lots of flowers beautiful view of the church the church is unbelievable ",
        "the backside you can see all of the flying buttresses in their glory although we have some scaffolding today this gives you a completely different angle the most people use most people are used to the postcard front and not so much the back but the back highly highly worth ",
        "so make sure you come and check it out and if you re lucky you ll get some really nice flowers as well i peas these are for my mom these flower shots are from my mom s specifically music the church itself took somewhere between a hundred and twenty ",
        "a hundred and like one hundred and eighty years to build i was looking up different timelines i ve been it kind of depends on when you consider the beginning of construction in the end of construction officially not an expert sure somebody below can leave you an answer and ",
        "has you know an answer that was different than i was expecting that s why i m feeling a little bit less certain about it right now but can you imagine being the person who designed this thing and knowing you re gonna die along before you ever see it ",
        "pretty crazy it s also interesting because so many different architects four or five different architects oversaw the construction of this church which means that the styles as you get higher especially the towers in the front differ and one of the fun things that i like to do and ",
        "don t think a lot of people notice is sit in front of the church and actually pay attention to the differences in styling from one tower to the other because they re not symmetrical they look like they re symmetrical at first glance they re not symmetrical music applause ",
        "rose windows are incredible they re the giant circular windows filled with stained glass and they actually removed all the stained glass during world war two to prevent it from getting bombed out basically they were well not to prevented from getting bombed out but if it got bombed out ",
        "way they wouldn t at least lose the glass which obviously would cause some serious problems maybe hit it all in the catacombs wandering into speculation now but i m pretty sure they hid all the glass in the catacombs and then put it all back in after the world ",
        "over which is pretty incredible so it s all the original glass and there s actually a stained glass museum you can see here in town which gives you a good idea of like the ways that they used to make and maintain all the stained glass in the city ",
        "things about entering notre domon you ve never been here before maybe an intimidating looking line don t worry they re just doing a quick security check always moves quickly i ve never been in line out here for more than like minutes and that s rare even this line ",
        "it lasts like five minutes another thing is guys you can t wear hats ladies your shoulders have to be covered obviously it s easier to take a hat off than to cover your shoulders if you don t come prepared so ladies make sure you got something to cover ",
        "shoulders up you got to be modest we re in church this church actually has suffered some massive massive vandalization over the years the most recent the one the biggest is probably when the revolution took place and they turn this into a temple of reason i think that s ",
        "they decapitated the statues the have nots all the statues a lot of the statues that they re still actually the heads are on display at one of the museums here in town the spire the th century spire was torn down so you come see the new big black ",
        "spire that s not old i mean it s old years old hundred fifty years old there are a lot of additions and stylizations that changed in the th century as they re trying to modernize the turks in france and so yeah i m not sure i don t ",
        "m not i don t know to what extent that all happened but it s really interesting to look at this stuff to recognize that well the church itself is in the range of like years old something like that there are a lot of elements to it that aren ",
        "that old at all music hats off anyway should have shaved before i did this it s gonna check your bag till you take your hat off no you no drinks or food or whatever inside and no flash photography but this kind of photography is okay because i m ",
        "using a flash music let s the adult some bleachers but normally what i like to do very first thing is walk straight to the center and look all the way up the church it s unbelievable and when they re using incense and stuff in here it gets kind ",
        "smoky this place gives you a good sense of just how ginormous this place is these bleachers are kind of ruining it but not entirely in whichever direction you want to go is fine from here but i tend to go counterclockwise i think that s the intended direction since ",
        "entrance is over here the exits over there just walk around check out the alcoves if you want to light a candle you can leave a donation to do that and if you re lucky they might be doing mass or having a choir singing and it sounds incredible in ",
        "when they do basically czar for me to talk to you right now that they don t i m kind of said that they don t have one going right now music silence music music well so what we re missing at the top of the church are a couple ",
        "one is that there s actually a scale model of the entire church made out of wood so keep going around the top and definitely worth it the other thing is that there s actually an example maybe i ll talk outside at the church that we re missing out ",
        "unfortunately is a model of how they built the church it s really fascinating if you ever watch there s a cartoon we watched in french class in high school she s amazing but there s somebody like ingenuitive ways that they ve actually built the arches everything one of ",
