        "Jay, you nailed it!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the M\u00e9tro Jaur\u00e8s footage. Out of the blue, I started bawling; I didn\u2019t realize how much it would impact me to see my other home. When you passed the fountain with the Invader, I lost it. That was one the first things I saw when I arrived in Paris for the first time. I have a great pic of my son at that fountain, too. You all probably walked right past my old apartment\u2014 rue Lally-Tollendal. I feel fortunate there was a stage in my life there where I went to the Buttes Chaumont every day. I was lucky/blessed enough to be able to do that. Truly, thank you. This was absolutely perfect of the 19th. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc97",
        "Jay, I ran into your blog the day after the Notre Dame fire.  I was looking for stories on the fire....well one thing led to another and I started becoming captivated by your 20 in 20 series...that led me into wanting to learn more about you.  Well done sir!  I am 54, perhaps older than many of your viewers?  However, I have lived in Europe twice (Vienna and Berlin) when I was younger and traveled through Paris both of those times and on my honeymoon.  Your blogs really have brought me back to another time in my life but also have left me wanting to move back to Europe.  I really like your mix of personal stories and exploring.  Keep it up!  You have me hooked.",
        "No shit, I was watching Puxan\u2019s new video and right when he was talking about you and your daily vlogs, my phone lit up with this notification \ud83e\udd23"
