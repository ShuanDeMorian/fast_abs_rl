        "Just found out my husband's boss was at a private dinner in Paris that you filmed.  They go to Paris every year!  Small world.  When he found out we are going in May and that we were watching your videos he said he had met you.  They also watch your vlogs.",
        "There is one reason why riding WITHOUT a helmet for proficient cyclists is preferable, streets with motorists. When cycling most motorists leave around 60cm (2ft) when confronted with a bicycle. That is enough for the cyclists to not feel crowded. However, when motorists see cyclists WITH a helmet that distance drops to 45cm (1.5ft). That holds true for ALL 'cycle cities', including the cities like Amsterdam, Berlin, Copenhagen, Munich and the like. Various scientific research has been done and it seems to be 'hard' evidence.\n\nHowever, those who are not proficient should wear one AND USE LESS CROWED venues to practice. For instance, where cities like Amsterdam, Copenhagen or Utrecht, are a joy to bike through for the proficient cyclists, please, if you are not, stick to the parks and less travelled streets.\n\nAnd, yes, I couldn't leave it alone \ud83d\ude09",
