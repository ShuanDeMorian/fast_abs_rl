        "There\u2019s some pretty good shopping on Avenue de Ternes as well\u2014 although heavy on the chains\u2014 if people are curious. The 17th was the first area I ventured out to in Paris all by myself from the 19th. My ex husband worked there. I have a lot of memories of it there! Also, the Promenade Pereire has those arbors you showed and they EXPLODE with roses in early June! \ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39 It\u2019s very pretty and a great place to take photos, if people are into that! Thanks, Jay. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\u270c\ud83c\udffc",
        "I stayed in the 17th when I was there last week. It was beautiful. A quiet area away from a lot of touristy stuff, which liked. Great location for us. We stayed at the Art Hotel Batignolles. Great little boutique hotel."
