        "They will be watching The 20 for years. It\u2019s a perfect tool for people planning a visit",
        "If Jay will permit me a few extra details!\nInside the lovely Gare de Lyon is the Gal\u00e9rie des Fresques (the Fresco Gallery) which contains some stunning paintings of the destinations served from the train station.  The Gare de Lyon was the Paris terminus of the Paris, Lyon, Mediterranean railway (before nationalisation) - you get the picture - some of most glorious railway destinations in France wonderfully illustrated on the walls of the Gal\u00e9rie - well worth popping in.\n\nBang opposite the station is the restaurant L'Europ\u00e9en with its hall of mirrors interior somewhere between Art Nouveau and Art D\u00e9co - it's quite the Parisian dining experience especially if you like seafood (try the oysters)."
