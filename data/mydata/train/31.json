        "because just so you know airlines do change their prices on different days of the week people are looking more for flights on like a friday than they are on a tuesday so sometimes the prices are a little bit lower midweek but in general tickets to italy are a ",
        "less expensive than i expected obviously they range but you can find cheaper flights if you look hard enough once you land in italy they use euros there so obviously if you re coming from the us or a place where the currency is valued a bit less during that ",

        "of frustration it was sort of just this experience where there was this random charge that didn t have a very good explanation going back and forth nobody really understood the charges and what they meant and there were random up charges and it was just a very confusing situation ",
        "times that i experienced it i would highly recommend that you do not go through a third party or booking agency goes straight to the source go straight to your main car rental place like your hurts your budget all of those main car rental companies go straight to them ",
        "there s going to be a charge that just is there s no purpose for it wanted to mention that i think it s completely worth it to pay a little bit extra each day for a trunk that is separate instead of getting a car that is all one ",
        "where you can turn over the backseat and see the trunk it s better to get a trunk that is completely separate and that locks separately once you are in the car you are now driving in another country which good on you because that is a huge learning experience ",
        "it s very empowering i drove when i was in france i loved the experience it didn t drive in italy but i was a passenger for about a month and i realized that people in italy don t always abide by the rules of the road here in la ",

        "that way and napoli they eat it like a big pie they use a fork and a knife or they use their hands and tear it but they mostly use a fork and a knife and they cut like from the middle or from the side they eat it just ",

        "J'adoro italia!!! I can't wait to go back too! Here's a few other things I learned during my 3 weeks in Italy. 1) The locals only drink lattes in the morning. It's not a huge deal if you order one in the afternoon, but it's just not what they do. 2) Pedestrians in Italy are considered a blood sport! It took me 2 weeks to learn how to cross the street properly, which is basically, cross with conviction! Do not hesitate and do not show fear. I remember in Rome, I would make direct eye contact with the drivers as I was walking passed them. 3) Rejoice vegans and non-dairy people! Italy has LOADS of gelato without milk in it! Here in Canada, the gelato stores usually have just 4-6 non-dairy flavours and then there's like 30 flavours or more in the dairy selection. The gelateria in Italy have a seriously good selection of non-dairy flavours including many in chocolate. Yes, this is heaven.",
        "Also, siesta is a Spanish concept. In Italy shops are traditionally closed in smallest cities and towns as in Italy people tend to eat lunch at home and spend time with family members and kids (who are in school only up until 1.30ish), it's all about families and enjoying time together, rather than about napping - only small children take naps really, although I do agree that having daily naps for everyone would be wonderful! \ud83d\ude0a\nAs for pizzas not being sliced, that's how pizza gets eaten in most European countries so one could argue that that's how you're supposed to eat it, so really no 'weirdness' there. The reason behind it is that pizza is best enjoyed hot and can become cold very quickly - by cutting one slice at the time it stays warm for longer. Someone from Italy or Europe could argue that the American way is weird, but the beautiful thing about our world is that every country is different and that travelling around makes you see and appreciate that \ud83d\ude0a",
        "Yes in italy we go home about at 1 pm to eat and start the afternoon about at 4 . I suggest to go to a supermarket or a bar and buy some food and don't go in a super tourist restaurant ...in case of emergency just remember that mc Donald is always open ! \nAnd about pizza ..cut it in slices with a knife and a fork but then please please eat with your hands \nHope you like our country cause it's so beautiful \ud83d\ude0a (sorry if my english may be bad)"
