        "I am watching this myself and it says \"No views\" but there is 1 like and already a comment... I feel that YouTube may be a little tricky with their numbers :) Big Roman Hug to You All!!",
        "I was in Rome for 14 days in May (and yes you need that much time to do it right); some more advice...\n\nFirst - Plan! Plan! Plan! and when you're done, plan some more! Rome is a daunting city, but if done right, you will LOVE it.\nDo not just show up and expect to see everything. Book ahead! Seriously, treat visiting the major sites like booking a Broadway play during Christmas season. All museums and sites have online booking options (except for the Vatican Museums, their online booking portal was down...bummer!). Some sites are so popular and space limited, you MUST book ahead (Borghese Gallery and the Domus Aurea especially). \n\nSecond - Don't go in summer (mid June - early September). I know vacation times may make this unavoidable, but seriously, Rome is hell in summer. The Italians leave, the tourists flood in...crowds are thick, the heat is beyond insane, prices skyrocket and many neighborhood eateries are on summer holiday. I was there in August 2003 and wow, it was miserable!\n\nThird - Take your time! If you only have a 4 days, then focus your trip on a theme: Ancient Rome, Catholic Rome, foodie Rome, etc...if you try to conquer everything in a few days you will be exhausted, bewildered and you probably won't have many fond memories. If you have 2 weeks, just do Rome and save Florence/Venice for another trip; you'll thank me. And if you're concerned you will have too much time, there are wonderful day trips to do...I recommend Orvieto (1 hour by train north from Rome), which is one of Italy's best hill towns!\n\nLastly - Get out the center of the city. Rome gets \"real\" outside the main areas. Go to the Salario neighborhood (one of Europe's grandest urban areas...kind of like a colorful Paris) Testaccio for some good food and art scenes, and Esquilino (where the Rome meets the world: Chinese fashion entrepreneurs rub shoulders with Lebanese hooka bars and Bangladeshi children play cricket in the park).\n\nRome is awesome, plan well and enjoy!",
        "Air BnB is the way to go if you stay in Rome. Hotel prices are crazy. I also recommend getting the Roma pass."
