        "we always love to stay an air b b we ve just found it the cheapest and most comfortable and for what it offers it s exactly what we want from a trip as well so we stayed in paris for three days with airbnb we come to pounds so ",
        "airbnb was about minutes walk away from the opportu triumphant rumble is a which for us was a great location as we said we like to walk around the city so being nice and central is a massive bonus and we loved the kind of place we stayed in it ",
        "just a studio apartment but it had a kitchen which of course means you can do all of your cooking and have breakfast there which saves a lot of cost as opposed to a hotel and it had a nice comfy bed i think it was a little tv in ",
        "room yeah the bathroom was lovely actually and it just had everything you would want in one little space it was really really cool they had a little desk as well so you could work on your laptop and yeah we found that ibm b to be such a great ",
        "place and we really enjoyed our three nights there yeah but of course paris is still one of the most expensive places to stay even with airbnb but it is still cheaper than staying in a hotel yeah absolutely so we did a little bit of research into hotels in ",
        "we always do really even though we re pretty sure we re going to end up in an air b b anyway and for a half similar location or just a good location in general but even for a three star hotel it s still going to set you back ",
        "pounds a night minimum which is you know nearly double the price of the air b b ended up costing us and you know when you can stain an airbnb and have cooking facilities all of that stuff we just find it so much the quality is just as good ",
        "a hotel exactly exactly and even we actually ended up looking at hostels and because that was something i did when i first when i was i traveled around europe for a month i stayed in hostels of the times i was the cheapest place for me and when me ",
        "rebecca first went traveling around asia i thought that s where we may be spending most of our time but air b b is just still worked out to be cheaper especially when you re traveling as a couple so we had a look in paris and it was still ",
        "a night each so it s going to be pound for both of us to stay in a bed dormitory in paris and i don t won t pay any extra pound of night if you go from an eight bed dormitory to our own rented a studio yeah so ",
        "if you re a couple half the time hostels are going to be more expensive and even if they re just a little bit less what you definitely having be it s just recently and remember we re going to drop our heavy of the referral code in the description ",
        "so if you haven t used airbnb before and you want to give it a go use our code below and you actually get some money off your first day which is pretty cool next up we are going to be talking about our favorite places the places we feel ",

        "there across the bridge and just had an amazing time eiffel tower was amazing however if you re gonna go up it s quite expensive it s over euros each i think and that s maybe just to get to like the middle tier more and it was super busy ",
        "well so we would recommend going up the arc de triomphe i knew it was year old yeah well and the view was incredible you could see the eiffel tower it was and all of the roads on trumbull is a yep so beautiful and so after we went up ",
        "thing since it opened it wasn t even that busy no we didn t really have to queue so we definitely recommend doing that if you want to go up and see like an aerial view of paris yeah there is montparnasse tower as well that we had a look ",
        "and but again it was more similar timeful tower prices we haven t done that but for our recommendation definitely going to the top of arc de triomphe we were not disappointed and it is the cheapest and when you re in paris of course you have to stop off ",
