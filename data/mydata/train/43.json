        "i can t do math anyways we are under the eiffel tower this view right here used to require no security back when i lived here before which is unfortunate that that has changed this is incredible and this is actually built to be the entrance to the world s ",

        "i think it only took from months to pay off all the construction costs so it s just like pure profit and just cream after that but this view from underneath well worth taking a look before you go up and then and then we ll go good tickets here ",
        "there ticket offices at each of the pillars and you ll see the symbols for stairs or for elevators i m going for stairs at least to go up the east ticket office on the southern pillar should do the trick here you ll see right here okay east ticket ",

        "the view simply because you re still among the buildings of the city the higher you get the less definition in context you have in the past time i liked it as much we ll see what happens today but this is pretty cool music i m very glad that ",
        "missed that longer line that s like four times longer such a slow security line man i want to check it out because i don t actually know for sure which floor the restaurants on i think it might be what s behind me but i m not sure about ",
        "so we re gonna do a little bit more exploring to see i didn t see a nice drink walking around but we ll we ll keep going and we re gonna take the stairs up to the second floor after that that we have to take an elevator to ",
        "top you can t hike that let s go here s the restaurant just across the way also this will give you a mild sense of vertigo if your eyes it s unfortunate if you ve been to chicago at the sears tower and i think at the cn tower ",

        "Hi Jay.  I saw how you told the pickpocket you don\u2019t speak English.  The same thing happened to me at the Berlin Wall today: a lady with a survey paper asked me if I spoke English. Remembering this video. I said in perfect English, \u201cNo I don\u2019t\u201d.  She looked at me with shock. Another tourist heard,and chuckled with amusement.  If I hadn\u2019t seen this video I would not have had that clever reply.  So, thanks, Jay!  I\u2019ll be a Parisian tourist tomorrow and will heed your good advice.",
