 hey for vlogedy 984 I'd like to tell you one of my deepest secrets once upon a time when I was a little boy well we have to go back even farther than good morning I'm on my way to the Pantheon this morning it started a little photo walk with LM Janelle and amber because why not it's looking like it's gonna be beautiful day today even with a little bit of the gray skies the idea is we're gonna do their photo tour today just see what that's like go on a walking tour with them straight what it's like get some fun photos maybe the best part of the day I've ever had and then go grab a bunch of Pan Am Brewing Company with my buddy John because I haven't been a Pan Am in a really long time it's early and yet I am still late because I forgot my backpack is broken and I had to repack the dang tote bag and I have another backpack I just need to go get it out of storage that's all another story though we can talk about backpacks and Achaia right when I got I need that backpack tomorrow at least it happened while I was home if it had broken while I was traveling that a little bit brutal whoo I'm done onward and upward [Music] oh yeah there's no way I'm making this one we just decided to get coffee first which I thought we were gonna do anyways but that means together she's drugging locations of foods need to be transferred to stops ago well I tried I have to wait two minutes for the next one that's one of the nice things about living in Paris though it's only ever a couple minutes to the next train during the week [Music] all right this morning we're gonna be going through the five best photo spots for spring in Paris kind of forgot that part earlier why are there always sirens and I'm trying to record anyways we're gonna do this real quick we're gonna not sprint but we're gonna blast through a whole bunch of great spots this is not the usual tour but if you were to book one of their private tours that would take you on this tour they do have group tours you can do as well that go through a different route that maybe will hit one of these days but for today we're gonna go to the good spots for spring [Music] those terrible don't you can go inside and it's a botanical garden but it was originally a garden that's how you got huh there's a lot of beautiful gardens in Paris there's like the Germany Luxembourg or like the Tuileries often they're very packed full of a lot of people a lot of tourists and sufferers some of these other gardens are just a little bit more quieter and so it's just a really nice place to come in have a picnic or relax and what's cool about our Paris and actually the design of Paris and this particular architect named husband when he was renovating Paris in the 1850s he wanted to make sure that for every Parisian you didn't have to walk through them in like 15 minutes to have a place of contemplation so there's a lot of really beautiful gardens 15 minutes from wherever you are I guess you can enjoy life and contemplate and this is a really beautiful one look at these beautiful [Music] the nice thing is during spring you have dozens of choices within the jardin de Perrault we just picked to feel free to spring uh-huh on as many as you want as you go and it's this place is there we go so good so let them run around there's no traffic or anything like that it's also great for individuals and couples keep it super peaceful and romantic and you can have a nice little stroll and really be in the moment so it's pretty good I like how she says it's peaceful and romantic as they're sweaty dudes running around shouting at each other [Music] the tiger [Music] this is very beautiful it cost three euros per person to get in unless you're a student then it's two years super worth it beautiful you just can't go into the prayer room aside from that open to visitors just in case you didn't know where we're at as well this is the Grand Mosque of Paris is she opened the library for us as well she said she think he's over here [Music] totally worth three bucks for three euros I keep you know I've stopped using currencies as a whole I'm sorry [Music] we've crossed over the river we're now on the right bank we were on the left bank for those of you who feel like I neglect the left bank anyways we're going to a really famous street a leukemia which is very famous and also something we have notes about it because you got a respective look at this the thing is that I wanted to say is that you want to be respectful of the residents they've actually petitioned the city to build a gate to keep people out on the weekends because people like us come take photos and be obnoxious we're not gonna be obnoxious so you can come and take photos and not be obnoxious to recognize this is where people live don't get in the doors don't like do yoga poses with your leg up on people's property it's weird just don't you might end up in their Instagram account which if we're lucky we might as well I'll post the link to the Instagram account below where they're basically just publicly shaming people who act silly on the street it's pretty phenomenal I'm going to link to all the locations below as well that we hit in this video so you can find them easily when you're wandering the city on your own particularly with the morning asleep it's a famously pretty street but it's also a place where people live so which is true of all of Paris he's just recognized it's a real city where people actually live would you would think I wouldn't have to actually say but things have to get said you had a guy named Garrett and he came and I'm using his university photos of like graduation it was really cool we also had a ballerina who did some poses right in the middle of the street the huge tutu and it was really bright and blue and it looked really gorgeous with the backdrop of all the different colored buildings and the plants and stuff so in the cobblestone of course so it's came forward right here yeah [Music] like days away from turning into chair bosoms like this one look that's the chair plus I'm right so book them now before it's too late you don't have you gonna talk sorry yes what I refer to as promenade plant√©e but is more commonly known as who liveth this is used to be actually a railway line which went from East Paris right through the bestie however as you can tell right now it's not anymore it was transferred into a walkway and actually fun fact this was the inspiration for the New York High Line but we're gonna take a couple photos up here because it's really beautiful and the trees are starting to blossom so perfect for spring photos right [Music] the nice thing is that all of these areas that we're going to have flowers that bloom at different times so even if you miss like the tree there's a tree right behind me it's on the verge of blooming that's a lot of bird poop there's the roses that are going to be blooming soon that so anytime you come in the next couple of months you're gonna get different types of flowers amazing and then birds in bamboo so what are we doing here you can even like and then you can even go inside but if there's any a little more shadows but then just walk back out and then yeah of course ignore the trick so yeah it's hard to ignore the bird poop and everybody keeps talking about it that's the problem okay here we go [Music] alright so that was four out of the five unless you count the two in jardin de plant purists I guess we're gonna break for lunch I gotta go have a lunch a meeting with John like I said and then we're gonna rejoin to do one more thing we got a late start and normally we would just wrap this up together but we were cramming it in today so good about to have lunch come back and we'll do the next and last stop shortly after [Music] all right lunched ran home got a little bit of work done dropped stuff off but I still have the coffee from London from Paris to London back to Paris for the peloton I'm gonna drop it off for them nice little hey I was thinking about you present and then our last spot the fifth and final location for great spring photos to fill up your Instagram and then maybe a beer
