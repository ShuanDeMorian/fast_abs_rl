 it's long a 1008 1008 squatty up squatty up it's quite a young good morning and welcome to the beginnings of the æther on his month today we were pretty excited cuz Sean's out with me we thought we would have this on sale is a all to ourselves but know police are back out in force out here this morning for the G Legion which is a little bit of a surprise because we thought that things had calmed down over here that much so anyhoo we're gonna get to see a little bit of this on Sally's day we can't get to the Arc de Triomphe this morning but that's okay I've got videos about the Arc de Triomphe that I'll link you to somewhere around here so don't worry we're gonna head down towards Concord and bounce over to grab coffee at honor and we'll wander around there's a lot to see besides the sean's little Isaiah to be honest the Shaun's Elysees is one of the more overrated aspects of the entirety of Paris also the eight the least densely populated arrondissement in the entire city so this is not a place people really live and hang out it's more of a place that you know tourists wander anyway John it's still pretty open it's nice it's to come I mean we'll see it happens I'll say this and then we can end it here the the protests are ongoing they happen every Saturday but they're only on Saturdays if they get rowdy it's only in the afternoon and usually confined to a small area somewhere in town between république Boulevard us men and here sometimes besties but it's really easy to avoid and if you just pay attention and you listen to the cops and they give you instructions Saturday's are still pretty common you just have to deal with some of these roads and metro stops being closed down along the way that's the annoying part what's not annoying though is getting coffee at the bottom of this hill the shuttle they say is probably the most famous shopping street in the entire world so it does kind of hurt I mean maybe Fifth Avenue yeah okay baby Fifth Avenue but I don't know is that if Fifth Avenue doesn't have a fancy song from the 70s that you can [Applause] and so anyway the average Parisian would never come here it's not the kind of place that that Parisians go and honestly it has been overtaken by chains and you know there's some interesting places like obviously the Louis Vuitton flagship store would probably be an interesting one to go see if you're into that but aside from that the better shopping is going to be at least more fun shopping is going to be in places like the Marais where there's lots of boutiques and smaller places and designers that are available still instead of you know Zara and Samsung well so we're gonna will see this entrance is closed I want to I want to take you to Concord but one of the benefits hidden benefits having police barricades is that it means you can get out in the middle of a street you normally wouldn't be able to stand out in the middle of and get long shots of the arc to trip so it's not all a loss you can enjoy yourself just take advantage of it if you're on a Saturday wander around see where you can go and if the cops turn you away okay if the cops let you through okay and there's no harm in trying to find other ways around all right coffee might be off this morning we got to see if we can find a way oh you know what I bet if we go around and we get I can ask for lunch we're gonna go around the cops are all very friendly if you walk up to them you can always ask for directions helps if you speak French obviously but we're gonna go aroond and cut back in and see if we can't find our way to honor we keep failing to get through at these barricades which brings us closer and closer to madeleine and saint augustine which are the two churches that i wanted to go see so we might enter just diverting to those at this rate we'll see if we can't get through for coffee it's definitely not good for coffee business today alright we've got one more attempt we can turn right here we should be able to get close enough man one more barricade well we can at least go ask them if they'll let us through alright they let us through that was nice we just had to find the right entrance we're farther away from the presidential palace so that might be why they let us through but coffee if we get there in their clothes that's gonna be the ultimate disappointment oh yeah fair enough if we can't if they won't let us leave we've got at least we've got our whiskey supply set for a long time [Music] we made it finally ooh that is good that's very different you wanna try it that is that is like in a filter espresso we made it to honor which is the one place that I recommend in the 8th for coffee and we're trying out their invention of a filter shot which is basically making a filter through an espresso and I obviously need more of it ooh that's so different rest here for a minute and then on onto the rest [Music] caffeinated okay we're gonna I'm gonna do two churches I think I might lose fish on here in a minute but I'm gonna go to two churches that I have I don't know if I've ever actually been inside either of them so I might try to pop in them if they let me with the wheel then oh yeah take advantage of this open the street here and then bokmal so I'm probably home I don't really have very many recommendations for I should look and see what I've got in this neighborhood for like food in particular but the eight is you know it's nice for the upscale shopping for a couple of parks a couple of churches but I was hungry it's not where I would choose to go [Music] and of course don't forget the vias Raphael if you want to come and see a whole bunch of umbrellas it's right next to Madeline I've been I thought this is in the 2nd for the longest time so happy to finally actually find this thing [Music] it's a much darker church on the inside it's kind of exactly what I would expect it's beautiful when I see those domes in the middle are really cool overall that's the first time I've ever been into the Madeleine and I think I'm gonna have another first and go into sent a g'sten it's gonna make our way there now that Bhushan's left us there's an increase in sadness because of course having more pressure on in your life is a good thing but there'll be an increase in top speed as I don't need to go to a walking pace on my wheel let's roll this church is wildly different everything is made out of what not everything but so much of it is finished in wood this kind of makes you feel ah gives it a very different feel almost an old we feel kind of awesome more like a a more vibrant feel and that the altar whatever that D is over the altar super cool this feels if there was a church that felt like it belonged in Game of Thrones this week it's probably this one [Music] random fun fact it took me once I didn't know where this was until recently but this is the bridge that's also in the new Mission Impossible movie where she like snipes them and they have to spin out underneath it to avoid getting shot before Tom Cruise takes off and there's grand chase between her on the motorcycle and him in the car they actually did a pretty good job of maintaining a fairly sensible route through the city they did do a little bit of teleporting but if you watch that new Mission Impossible movie it's like it's a it's a it's a relatively logical route that they took I was impressed often with movies like that the routes they take for chase scenes make absolutely no sense okay there's one last thing that I wanted to show you in the 8 which is Park Mall so the 8th is also famous for its clubbing you know nightclubs that kind of stuff not really my scene also not something you can really film so you can figure that out on your own I'm pretty sure but in the meantime let's go check out pokémon so which is one of my favorite parks in the city it's a really nice quiet non touristy part which you should definitely check out [Music] in my opinion back home so is the it's definitely the gem of the eight I mean the arctic shrimps nice and I do love it and I think it was one of the best views of the city but this park is great it's got a lot of character its own ruins and everything it's just fun I really really really like this park so if you're gonna come to Paris and you need a park and you want to try a park that is less tried that is less touristed that is less well known but I mean well known among Parisians it's a good one I really like it anyway that's basically the eight over here it's my left right now is the 17th we won't get there for a while but we'll get there eventually and you've seen most of what the place has to offer including lots and lots of police right now which isn't is not normal don't worry it's just on Saturdays so I don't think I don't know if I even explained that I was doing my 20 and 20 day 8 today or not but thanks for tuning in for my 20 and 20 day 8 8 through our nice amount of Paris I hope you having a wonderful day wherever it is you are and I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for a day spent wandering through the night of Paris see [Music]
