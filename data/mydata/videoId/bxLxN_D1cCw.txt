 it's a little bit anticlimactic but today is vlogger day 1007 I was much more excited [Music] good morning and welcome to another beautiful day in Paris today is my seventh day of the twenty and twenty which means we are in the seventh arrondissement gonna swing around again the seventh arrondissement is famous not in and of itself you might not know it by its number but you know it by its tallest monument and it is the tallest monument in all of Paris if not the most visited monuments and all of Paris the Eiffel Tower I'm gonna be going under it push ons with me if you haven't seen them swinging through the background yet we're gonna wander down the shonda moss which is the famous garden that runs behind the Eiffel Tower all the way to the echoed melee attack or the military school and of course we got to get ourselves a breakfast burrito at SIA because that's all I can think about [Music] that's with every Ron Dee's mom very well I should maybe not every Ronnie's mom Paris but then 7th has its share of museums as well some of which you'll know better than others but kamalani right here has massive exhibitions I've never actually been inside this one but it is got this kind of fantastically modern feel with I believe a restaurant or a bar that you've got a great view of the Eiffel Tower from so if you wanted to come get a drink it's probably a little bit expensive but I would definitely recommend coming here and sitting outside and enjoying a drink with a view of the Eiffel Tower might be one of the better ones available this close to the Eiffel Tower itself but we're not going up there because it's probably not even open yet we're going around the corner get ourselves a copy and a breakfast burrito [Music] this Shonda Mars or the fields of Mars the God of War were a training ground back in the day for the French military and now our training ground for your palate it's a great place to come have a picnic wandered around the grass is open finally usually different sections are under repair but right now if you look over here it's all open you come sit watch the Eiffel Tower sparkle bring your own you know drinks and such because you can they're guys that are walking around that'll sell you a bottle of wine and you can negotiate but you won't get a very good deal from them unless you're particularly good negotiator I've definitely walked away with a couple of good deals over that over the years but I've also seen people make some really really terrible deals this is also where I started my thousandth vlog of the day and if you didn't realize it in that video it was Oliver and Lina on the scooter that had the number one just in case you missed that part we're gonna head all the way to the top of the Shan to Mars though if you go all the way to the top right by the echoed meaty tear of the military school turn left that's when and how you'll find Zia yeah and Zia not only has a good coffee but again some tasty food they've got a market based menu as well and they're the ones who are redoing their restaurant so we might check in on the restaurant progress right now we might not we'll ask well that's Justin when we get there assuming that he's there [Music] voila [Music] breakfast burrito consumed and I've got Justin at the last minute we're gonna go check out the restaurant see how that update is going for those of you that are interested in the restaurant progress and I'm just I'm just a happy camper post burritos [Music] oh you don't have any lights done all right not much to see down here then currently riding the dumbwaiter to freedom just might take a while to get there yeah I was gonna say are you you're working pretty hard there yeah I've made it to the up the up stairs off let me let me get off if you come eat at Justin's restaurant once it's finished I'm pretty sure you will not get the elevator service life goals for those of you who aren't necessarily tracking Justin owns eeeh where we were just at and this is gonna be his new restaurant that he is currently in the process of redesigning and putting together and they finished the demo and this place looks really different and really good so far so it's exciting so if you want to have winner you hope you know have you buy so if you're coming in the fall don't worry we'll keep we'll keep you up-to-date with the progress of the restaurant as we go [Music] the dome of Eleison believe is visible behind me I think but they're getting ready for the what did you say formula E Grand Prix ie all-electric if I promote you racing so that's how many many Harris so that like a big truck it goes wrong on buddy yeah all the way like to the river it comes back it's really cool I snuck in the paddock last and then I got kicked out they make less noise than these street cars school fans the future that's we need to go green the future of racing so they're setting up for a race so we it looks like we might be able to still go inside here I think so yeah it's debating whether or not we should go in to lay somebody but if they'll let me move my wheel why not let's give it a try this thing is a giant cluster right now for the erase that's coming up but it'll look a lot prettier here again soon once they're done with that we'll go inside one of these days actually they're a couple of museums in the area that I've been in before but I wanted to do again like the road uh museums right around the corner and then this is the Museum of the army as well as Napoleon's tomb underneath the big gold dome highly worth day it's really really nice in the summer it's actually really nice and cool especially for a city that does not have a lot of air-conditioning so definitely recommended we're not gonna go in today also pretty sure they won't let me in with the wheels so we'll come back and do this again later we're just trying to summarize what's in the 7th for you today the road Emmys team is one of my favorite museums in the whole city if not I don't know it's my favorite Museum it's very small it has an indoor and an outdoor component there are some van Gogh paintings inside even just to mix things up very very worth it I've done a couple videos there before I'll probably come back and do another one again just because I like it so much very worth it the other thing to know the museums aren't really that expensive to get into but this is more expensive neighborhood so if you're gonna eat have anything to drink here it is gonna be a little bit pricier so just so you know and there is a cafe in the Rodin Museum not as good as the places that we're gonna be going to but definitely it'll scratch that itch if you've got it [Music] they're renovating the Chinese Theatre right now we're going to Koo tomb which is one of the there are a couple of big Coffee Roasters in Paris they're one of the bigger ones and they've got a nice spot over here not laptop friendly which is probably I haven't caught him in a long time but you know the coffee is good and the snacks are tasty so why not get a second coffee I mean really [Applause] the open wall is making me really happy Li's I have been in a long time it's a really nice location though it's this is a great spot to sit and chill back now what okay so maybe they're a bit more laptop for live it used to be you were saying that you had a story this is what kind of gotten you in the coffee yeah so actually it was back in 2012 or 13 I was coming back from trip in India and my friend Lacey is roasting in consumed the roaster used to be here oh there's a little mini one but they had the main one there and I showed up here like 5:00 a.m. I didn't really know anything much about specialty coffee but she was spitting the beans around and I was really cool smells good had a really good coffee and that's how I become a coffee geek ended up going around I was just supposed to shoot her roasting for a few minutes and I didn't up go to different coffee shops that kami receive would you not like I feel like made this documentary on the arrival especially coffee in Paris so if you want you can check that out my youtube don't subscribe to him on youtube if you haven't done it already you're missing out big time he's also we're making something together if you didn't notice can't tell you anything else but you know go subscribe before he means it [Music] on the other side of the lazy somebody lead from the river it's this really long Park there's some barnyard animals will show you out here that they put out in the spring which is pretty great this is definitely an underrated park it's very quiet very calm you'll see some students here do you want to come have a picnic where there aren't a lot of tourists just the other side of on bedding and when I say other side I mean from from the river better Naza [Music] cheaper than hiring someone to cut the grass [Music] one of the other unsung benefits of the seventh something that makes this neighborhood well worth visiting even though I would say there's not a lot of food or good coffee or good places to have a drink it is beautiful it is calm and it's loaded with tons and tons of awesome shots of the Eiffel Tower so if you want to come get really really nice contextual shots the Eiffel Tower down long streets boulevards the market that we just shot up whatever it is this is the neighborhood that's going to get you the Eiffel Tower shot of your dreams so come to the 7th for that [Music] and there you have it the seventh oldies mall in a nutshell there's one big thing that I didn't show I opted not to show today and that of course is musee d'orsay music d'Orsay I've not been in like seven years and I really really want to go back and actually spend some decent time there so I'll make an entire video based around that experience soon I didn't want to just kind of rush in and out it felt like it wouldn't be enough so lots of good museums musee d'orsay museum hold down the the Rodin Museum the army museum and they somebody eat along with Napoleon and handful of others along with some good coffee not as many great food options in that area and of course if honestly one of the things that I also want to impart when I make recommendations especially in my guide I didn't make recommendations that I really really love like that are high quality great environments usually as good or customer services you're gonna get around here but one of the things that I might stumble into and I don't really and I want to make sure that I'd say is a caveat is there could be a little bit of snobbery that creeps in there as you you know weigh your options and try to make the best recommendations possible so a good reminder is that when you're in Paris all you really need is a nice seat a cold drink and some good friends and wherever you are you're gonna have a good time so if you find a nice Brasserie on the corner grab a glass whatever wine they have on hand maybe a cheap beer you'll be happy it'll be good and this is a nice chill neighborhood in which to spend some time with friends or family and just enjoy a sunny day and have a nice cold drink anyway that'll do it for me today I hope you're having a wonderful day wherever it is you are join me again tomorrow for the eighth day of my twenty and twenty when we are in the 8th around yzma and I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for that [Music]
