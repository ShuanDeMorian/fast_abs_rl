 who's on fire see rugged a middle class by the balsa good morning and welcome to day 13 of the 20 and 20 today twenty and twenty twenty days spent visiting each of the twenty around his months in Paris one day at a time and making a video in each today I've got you Sean and Laura with me and we're going to see the thirteen which doesn't have a lot going on it is right next to the shotgun day plans but we're gonna find some stuff we're gonna find some good stuff because one of the recommendations that have of my guide is trustworthy chains places that you can find all over the city if you're in desperation and because I don't have a bakery that I know and love in the thirteenth I looked up an Eric Keizer which is one of those trustworthy chains in my guide and we're gonna go grab a croissant there to get started then we got a couple of fun spots we're gonna check out that are very non touristy but very worth it let's see what happens from there where you guys going but before we get officially started with the 13th Bhushan's got to get the fly invader on the mcdonald's next to jardin des plantes and then chris on coffee that's the other thing we don't I don't know I don't have any good coffee shops that I know of in the 13th so we're just gonna grab probably espresso at their Kaiser or something similar and it'll be fine it'll contain caffeine have you had caffeine yet she doesn't really need caffeine but Bhushan Bhushan's already had coffee too I'm the only one [Music] when you find this ugly green building on the river you basically want to go to the roof if it's in the summer and you feel like having a drink maybe dancing in the evening a rooftop the rooftop there I think there's a cafe aahs and something else that are up there so a little bit overpriced but definitely worth it for the view and you know you go there to dance you don't go there to get cheap drinks and what I didn't realize is that there's a fashion school in the downstairs so I guess during the day you can go get an education that's pretty great as you can tell the 13th is also modernizing it has been for a long time so it's got a lot of these very na Na's mini and building for those of you that are anti modernization in Paris it's probably not the neighbourhood for you one of the cool modern Eska buildings that we're gonna go see right now the National Library BPO technician editor but we're gonna go there hopefully after we get a croissant [Music] we finally found it there is also a crepe like an artisan crepe place next door this feels very Seattle in this part but the 13th isn't just downtown Seattle in its styling in its weather it is also a competition with some of the more outrageous elements of Parisian art culture and we'll see some of some good street art here in a minute but first croissant please this is definitely the most unique looking Eric Keizer that I've ever been in and the hugest weird huh I don't know if I like it but I'm sure that everything else would be delicious I got a quiche that's no story I need what I will be right back now I feel better we're making our way to the National Library next get has started to rain a little bit which is gonna have a mild effect on how things go today we've been able to dodge the rain for the last two weeks I guess it was gonna catch up to us eventually the library itself is pretty cool and kind of hoping I don't know if we can actually go inside today or not get a view from the top but it is pretty schmancy no go check out some street art and then we'll go to lunch one of the things that I've been meaning to mention almost the 30,000 subscribers which is really exciting and to keep with tradition at every new 10,000 mark I've done it question and answer a QA so if you'd like to be a part of that QA we'll go follow me on Instagram you haven't followed me in Instagram yet please do so right now I'm gonna do the QA through my Instagram story I'll put together some questions on the Instagram stories the day that I think I'm gonna cross earth at least the day that I'm gonna do the QA which is probably gonna be you we might have to save the QA for after the 20 and 20 so go follow me right now and as soon as the 20/20 is over I'll do the QA and I'm gonna do it through Instagram so if you want to ask me any questions that's the time and the place to do it and then you get some pretty photos out of it along the way as well I'm working on improving my photography game it's going up gonna be it's gonna be an Instagram account worth following that's my promise to you a chicken in every oven any of you let's go check out the library so street art and then this neighborhood is famous for its Asian food I went to the giant Asian market with jean-yves once if you want to see that video we're not gonna go to the Asian market today but we are gonna go eat some cuz it is soupy weapons [Music] what a bunch of nerds and for those three mission impossible fans this is where they enacted their plan in the new movie this way you'll recognize the columns from the motorcycles and the diversion I guess you could say that the diversion of the route happened here I don't know if I should be careful of giving spoilers for that movie it's been out for a long time now but it's gonna have the little Mission Impossible references as we go alright now the library right here I didn't know they took the leaves on the Titanic [Music] the BPO technician out of the national library is named after fall swami temple the president of France who famous for putting lots of stuff in place in Paris but they consist of four giant books right these buildings are supposed to represent or look like books that are standing on the corners of this huge square Bashan and said that we have to have a membership to go inside and all the way up I was kind of open to go all the way up but it doesn't sound like it's possible the other hope that I had was to do some fun time lapses but the cloudscape today is pretty flat so we'll give it a try and simply come up with still a really nice spot to come and sit if you want to go down on the river near here it's not so bad that you can sit out here in the Sun on the steps gonna watch the world go by not a touristy spot at all definitely takes a little bit of work to get here by comparison it's been a pretty long walk but it is really cool to come see if you've got a little time I wouldn't put this in like my top 10 things to do if you're in Paris kind of a thing but if you're here for a couple of weeks definitely worth bouncing out to see [Music] okay that was my favoritest thing I think I may have ever done oh that bridge is so great for the wheel ah I just want to do that again and again for the rest of my life not only are there party boats down here but there's a swimming pool boat that's a big boat with a swimming pool and like a gym there's a lot of modern life going on down here in the 13th and check this out a lighthouse party boat this is where Prashant spent a lot of time working on his thesis we're done librarian and bridging obviously you can go party on the river if you feel like it you can come watch a movie at a movie theater here in the middle of the library which is actually where I saw the first Hobbit movie before I realized that there was only the first Hobbit movie and not the only Hobbit movie it was a big disappointment Geoff something to say no chief I don't know I don't know you just looked like you had something to pitch in there oh I wrote my thesis here there was no Wi-Fi there was no Wi-Fi that's how I actually got worked on because I was that's gonna be the most like chopped up like him so we're gonna go grab some warm up over some soup basically between the partying studying street art which we actually didn't even go see the street arts up go up a long line six here I marked in my guide how to go and find good street art in this area and I've actually shown it on a couple of other videos in the past but that's that's that's basically the 13th in a nutshell it's fairly modern fairly residential and then the Asian food scene is pretty strong here too so I'm ready for lunch dr. house might be the single largest invader in the world this thing is three stories tall that's crazy it's great anywho if you go along line six north of the river which we're gonna do for a little bit you get some really big murals the Space Invader is not the only one there's a lot of really big street art on this 100 points a lot of great street art along here which we're gonna try and take advantage of [Music] this is a smaller branch of that massive Asian market that I was telling you about that I went to is Johnny definitely worth checking it out that's also the first time I'd ever had an uncooked peanut which was a life-changing experience didn't realize you that was even a thing change of plans buzz sounds good it will introduce Laura Defoe one of these days but this Chinese place is one of Phu Shawn's favorites so let's do that I don't know it just sounds really delicious and also there's a Mario invader next to it which is a sign [Music] [Applause] always a good idea to check the menu on the outside before you go in which is the nice thing as most restaurants and France will post the menu outside so you don't have to commit to sitting down before you know what you might want to get in the end I wouldn't recommend that spot there are a lot of really good Asian places around here Vietnamese Chinese the Vietnamese is probably what this area's most famous for which is why we should have gone for the pho oh well can't one of all we'll get one of these days Bhushan's crab where did push-on go sprinted across the street to get some food for his mom because he's a good son and to take that home to her so that was the 13th today it's a really big Ronnie's month there's a lot more to see lots more modern buildings and street art and markets and all kinds of stuff if you are if you're gonna be seeing in the 13th it is a little bit far from the rest of the world but you know it's another part of Paris that's worth seeing at least once in your life especially if you want to get that doctor house Space Invader woo so anyways I'm gonna work on digesting whatever we just ate and I will see you again bright and early tomorrow morning for a wander through the 14th arrondissement of Paris see you tomorrow you [Music]
