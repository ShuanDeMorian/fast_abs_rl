 a higher today b-vlog in a 1011 were one month away from lots of ones good morning and welcome oh no my sunglasses are my backpack to another 20/20 today is the eleventh day of my twenty and twenty she's basically me just bouncing around to every Ronnie's mount in Paris one at a time there are 20 of them and I'm hitting one each day for twenty days pretty straightforward today I'm in the eleven which is famous mostly for its food and nightlife it's a pretty local around ease month it's not too far from anything it's where I tend to think of when I think of bestie even though bestie is shared between a couple and it is the section that has the most boring portion of canal has the underground portion of the canal so if you are on the canal and you see water you're not in the 11th if you're on the canal and you don't see water you're in the 11th did I say that right it also has a lot of space invaders including this one which looks either new or I'm really surprised that I never saw it before alright detour over I'm gonna walk towards pot at home boom for coffee to start this morning and something to eat we all know them from when we did all those colorful lattes the matcha latte golden latte chai latte hot shot ooh I'm gonna get a mocha from them today because forgot that they do this in their chocolate is delicious and I haven't had a mocha in months sounds like a plan and then we'll move on north from here from there could I show you the map yet that's where we are today now you know okay moving on oh man so good this place is just warm and cozy and full of books it's a great spot to sit and chill it just changed up their menu for the summer too including like a pasta salad with marinated vegetables and it sounds delicious if only I were here for lunch today at our time we came up this morning I'm just gonna go ahead and sit here and do that slowly now I love those guys they're so nice make sure that you go to pull a home bow when you're here it's off the beaten path not remotely touristy it's great ooh from here you're gonna end up a bestie at some point I tend to think of besties let's do the long way I wish I had my wheel okay we'll go see besties first and then sanam was there clothes today but don't forget that there's a cat cafe just down the street if you're dying for some cat time while you're visiting Paris there are a few of them around town but that's one of the ones that's been there for a while and I don't know if I can recommend it exactly but you know give it a try this area on Thursdays and Sundays is one of the bigger markets in Paris if not the biggest market in Paris I'm not sure what the biggest outdoor market is in the city but this is a pretty long one bring from the bestie roundabout up a few blocks through this central piece it's open on Thursdays and Sundays something already said that and it has a delicious falafel it's a great market if you're here in the area and there's usually market opens somewhere most days in Paris but really makes a big difference between market days and nut market is all right this is close we're gonna get ooo you can go look and I have besties market videos you can check out I also have like in the nightlife video I made down here on Rue de La Roquette you'll see it in a couple of recent videos there's a lot of nightlife just south of Bali homeboy lots of bars lots of places to go in the evening if you get out of SD take Rue de La Roquette and that's where you're gonna find all that goodness it's where I got out when I went to pull at home boat to do the lots of video it's all over phone they have my wheel and I'm under the gun again today because the construction guys coming back to my apartment I'll tell you more about that when we're done during the 20 and 20 you'll see the results of his work but I got to do this fairly quickly and get home before he shows up and starts breaking stuff so that was that let's go check out some time was and the park that's next to it that I don't think I've ever seen also you might hear the glass behind me they're dumping out the massive recycling bins regions go through wine bottles fairly quickly if you weren't aware and they all get tossed into these giant recycling bins and then they dump them all at once and it makes for really loud noises in the morning so you know if you hear the world crashing and shattering around you it might just be recycling day [Music] let's give this a go I've never been in Sun Omelas before if this church is very close to where Jean Yves Atelier used to be before we move over to arts and metier so I've been over here I've seen this church but only in passing when coming out of the metro and the 2020s the perfect excuse to go into places I've never been before so let's go give it a try I've never I've never been in your court that was very nice is a much less ornate Church than some of the ones we've been into in the last couple of weeks oh man they're really missing my sunglasses right now I'm gonna put those on I think better ah what was really interesting there was the tile work in the floor very fine like very small tiles this is really nice that was really pretty and I really like the stained glass in there as well if you're in the eleventh you're near said I'm was might as well pop in and take him visit and you'll see some of these around as well cracking a very prolific street artist going around drawing octopi all over the city he's done some collabs with some other artists around but you'll see his Krakens all over the place if you pay attention now I don't know I just feel like wandering there's one thing I wanted to go do and see here but I'm gonna save it for another video later so I figure let's just wander around I'll give you a feel for the neighborhood and I just kind of want to do exploring areas that hadn't been yet I already found a couple space invaders hope to find some more and I have some ideas for lunch we'll see what we'll see what comes of that once we get to it well let's I was gonna say let's roll but you can't roll just wandered up here to check out this park I could just see a little bit of it it's nice quiet little park doesn't look like there's anything too exciting going on in it but right across the street totally forgot that I was up here I was a little bit turned around is beans on fire beans on fire or the beans on fire is a roaster local roaster good coffee but they also do wrestling for a lot of smaller places they have an area that they rent out to different people to do roasting so if you're in paracin you want to roast coffee there might be a little bit intense but the beans on fire would be the place to do it [Music] brooo oberkampf and parmentier are famous for their food and nightlife so if you want to go up over their camp or I was just done parmentier a minute ago I walked up from it but they cross just down here fantastic fantastic area lots of good restaurants a number of them in my guide probably going to lunch at one of those places shortly I gotta earn it though I gotta keep walking for a little bit but I have a I have a spot I really want to go I'm gonna keep wondering this is really nice just to explore a little bit it's been a while since I've walked all the way up over camp so I think I'll walk up it a little ways further and then I wanted to try and go down to the batterer clan cuz I haven't been there since they attack just uh yeah wander for about another hour before I find lunch just kind of nice to stroll this area again isn't very touristy not a lot of stuff to see in that bin but lots of stuff to eat lots of great places to go for a drink and just highly recommend you come here for the social elements of your time in Paris [Music] I don't know if this technically counts we're on the border between the 11th and the 20th right now this is Marsha the bed of Eden on my right to the 20th of my left is the 11th it counts it's only open on Tuesdays and Fridays according to one of the vendors that I just talked to so if you're here on a Tuesday or Friday here in the 11th or the 20th hop on down it's bouncing lots of fruits and vegetables you can buy yourself some coffee filters or garbage bags or you know cloth whatever you need lots of fish it's a pretty long one there's a lot going on here but definitely lots and lots of fruit very tempting to get a strawberry right now but I don't have any cash poor planning for markets like this more and more they have credit card machines like they'll be able to take credit cards but for small things and a lot of them probably only take cash best to have cash for an outdoor market like this [Music] okay gonna bounce left and continue my exploration back into the 11th cells like I'm playing with fire here cramming my way through a market that's on the borderlands you know I said the bestie market was a long one Belleville market feels even longer this is it goes on forever maybe it's because bestie has two lanes and this only has one but one thing you find in every year on DS moment I don't think I've hit on yet is Wallace Fountains they're these beautiful fountains that were installed a while ago I remember how long ago I feel like nigh on years I did some research at home I'm sure but that's fresh drinking water anywhere you go in the city to put your water bottle underneath it gather your water it's usually very cold it's delicious supposedly there are a couple of these around the city that are also sparkling water kind of like the sparkling water fountain I showed you in the second whether or not that's true I have yet to find any myself but in the meantime you get thirsty check out a Wallace tongue okay speaking of thirst I've wandered quite a bit I think it's time to go get lunch what do you think I think it doesn't matter what you think I think it's time to feed my stomach also if you're looking for a beer leave Brooklyn great little tap house it's fairly new it's in my guided so it's a nice spot to sit and have a drink also just realize that my microphone is off for the whole over camp market but the over camp market is also open on Tuesdays and Fridays firmly located in the 11th fantastic market it's pretty huge so if you're dying for some market time and you're looking to buy something to take back to your Airbnb with you fantastic way to do it well I'm on my way to the better clown I haven't been since the attack there was a Banksy on it that I think I've missed out on and probably I'll show it to you I'm probably gonna have a private moment there because I haven't been there since the attack and I just kind of refused to go for some reason just haven't haven't wanted to go so I'm gonna go check that out and then it's time for some American barbecue for lunch American barbecue you're saying there can't be any good American barbecue in Paris but oh yes there can are you probably also saying but Jay you're from Washington State what do you know about barbecue well I did live in Texas for a little while and I've been to the Carolinas and I'm not about to tell you which one I prefer because I don't want to put that target on my back I will say the barbecue I'm gonna go to you for lunch today huh nominal I'm actually really really hungry I can't wait for this now [Music] I was thinking brisket until I suddenly have a bull fork and that's all I wanted after I saw that [Music] place is fantastic I love it it is now that I've eaten it and double check to make sure I was gonna be correct and everything I said Texan style barbecue it was started by three French guys and a Texan chef and oh man it's so good it's like legit brisket the pulled pork was so good I haven't been back there in a while so I took this is the perfect excuse to go and if you saved my drone from a river this is the kind of place that I'd like to take you as a thank-you just hint hint anywho I got to go home I have a dude coming to wreck stuff in my apartment apparent hopefully not wreck anything hopefully just finished things but just think we'll find out he'll find out soon enough so I'm gonna leave you here I hope you've enjoyed a wander through the eleventh I have I found about eight or nine space invaders so that was great had some delicious food went to pull out home bow that's a recap for you I suppose I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for day 12 of the 20 and 20 I might even be joined by the famous Instagrammer deer Everest if we're lucky Kate will come along for a little bit and shed some light on some of her favorite photographic gems in the 12th and uh see you tomorrow for that adios you
