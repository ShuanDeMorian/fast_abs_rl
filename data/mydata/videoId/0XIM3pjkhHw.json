Which I had heard different people say were lost to the fire.  I had also assumed that when the roof collapsed, it fell all the way in... as  in, the vaulted ceilings had also collapsed.  Just before I went to bed, I was scrolling through my newsfeed and caught sight of one of the first photos from inside the cathedral... firefighters standing in inches of water within a cathedral that was still largely recognizable!  First thing I did this morning when I got to work was research to see if the rose windows were intact.  On my first visit to Paris just over 7 years ago (actually got to stick my head in for a few minutes during the Easter Sunday morning service back in 2012), I was there for about 4 weeks.  We were staying across the river near the Pont Neuf, so every chance I got, I would go into the cathedral... like you, just because I could... or because it was cold out or because I needed a break...  The stained glass being my favorite part, of course.  It is a beautiful building, massive, but still warm and inviting.  The scale of it all somehow manages to give you a sense of comfort and safety when you walk through those beautiful wooden doors.  Yesterday was heartbreaking.  (Even though I had already heard the news and been watching other live streams... I thought of you and found your broadcast of the fire... I knew what was coming when you came up out of the metro, but my heart sank and my stomach turned again as it did when I first saw the flames, and when the spire collapsed...)  But today is new, today feels hopeful... still a bit heartbroken and bittersweet, but hopeful.  Thank you for your commentary and coverage of all of this!",

I stayed for a month in an apartment on Rue des Rosers in the 4eme on my first trip to Paris. It holds a very special place for me. I was next door to the Jewish bakery, Sascha Finklesteins, and had 3 falafel shops in throwing distance of the apartment. Las du Falafel being my favorite!  The owner of the apartment took me to Au Petit Fer \u00e0 Cheval around the corner on Rue Vielle de Temple. Highly recommend.",
