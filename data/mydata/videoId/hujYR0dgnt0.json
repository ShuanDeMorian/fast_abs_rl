Rome is still connected to the past and its progression is going slowly (thx God) especially if you think that&#39;s a Capital!! there are many other italian cities like Milan and Turin that are already above Rome in terms of progress. That&#39;s why I love Rome! And if you like to see more of Italy I suggest you to go to south Italy!!! there you can find many many places when it looks like the time has stopped at 20 or 30 years ago like in Naples or in Matera or in Sicily (this is where I come from)!!!<br />anyway living in London for us (southern Italians more then others) is a great experience... it opens yor mind and makes you see things that you couldn&#39;t even imagine... eather way bad things or good things.",

The hotels and b&amp;b near Trevi and Transtevere are really good, but if you want to book a cheeper hotel you can also consider the Termini zone... that&#39;s near to the main attractions, the bus and the metro stations. I love Rome and I hope you will love it as much as I do \ud83d\ude0a",

I stayed near the Trevi Fountain and found it to be a great location to the Spanish Steps, the hills, city centre and it&#39;s within walking distance to the Colosseum too! If you want to stay outside of the centre, Travastere is a local area FULL of amazing restaurants and bars. It&#39;s a lot more quaint! I used the Sony RX100 MK IV - amazing camera and really good with low-light. I&#39;ve since upgraded to Canon G7X MK II though and the quality is even better so would recommend that! :)",
