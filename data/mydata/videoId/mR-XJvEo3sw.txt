 roar today is rogue day 524 morning it is almost seven o'clock I got up at 6:30 this morning which is kind of crazy because it went to bed at a decent hour 11:30 I was hoping to sleep more than seven hours honestly I was hoping to sleep for like nine hours or so but I woke up at five hours made myself go back to sleep didn't print my body's getting used to sleeping in for only about five hours at a time so we're gonna go back up to seven I made myself sleep some more but now just kind of a wake I don't feel super great about that but that's okay I'm gonna go for a run I kind of wish I was more of a morning person because if I get up go for a run and then right for a few hours before having lunch and then work for in the afternoon that would be ideal just like we were talking about last night so I'm gonna try and put that into practice this year as we enter 2018 there's some improvements to the vlog you want to make there's some changes I want to make and there are some changes to my lifestyle I want to make I I've gone through a really long stressful period obviously with the prefecture there's still some big stressors to come but I've taken care of some stuff recently doesn't maybe this fit is inappropriate for having the cow the lighting setup is currently and my schedule is one of those really big things that I really want to make alterations to because I don't want to be so jam-packed and overworked that I'd kill myself at a young age because that's basically what I'm headed towards right now so to keep from killing myself from working myself to death I'm gonna go for a run now and then this afternoon I'm gonna go see Star Wars which is exciting I ran because my running apps too won't let me sign in I submitted a ticket we'll see we can figured out the reason I know getting a lot of the suggestions is there other running update news I've used others the reason I wanna use this one because a I paid for it while ago and B my dad and I shared a leaderboard on it and I want to be putting up my score here tell me that I can't anyways it's kind of depressing that I went for an entire run probably a 5-mile run and it's only now just ready to get light that's okay I think technically today or yesterday somewhere around here is the first day of winter which means that it's only gonna get lighter from here so we're on our way it's all uphill from here you guys just needed some change you couldn't you should have rode with me have been much more efficient so this was left for me this got here on the December 6th apparently which is like right after I left so to spend sitting here for a couple weeks Angela Thank You preemptively whatever's inside unless it's the head of one of my loved ones in which case no thank you that was not okay that is a thick card oh that is a great business president there like American Standard that is an American Standard boy well Canadian standard in this instance yeah every time I go there's always a bowl full

from into the nantan I finally started building a little online store so we can manage all of that and all of the prints are back in the states with my sister she's gonna help me fulfill those so if you guys would like to get those I'll be sure to link to those of you who have already said specifically that you want one but I'll be sure to link to the store here as soon as it goes live just got to kind of keep putting it together but in the meantime it's time to go get some Chipotle and then Star Wars which is the exciting part of the day because I've been wanting to go see it and that also means that no longer have to actively avoid spoilers online which has been really freaking hard because I keep seeing that stupid post about everywhere I don't think it's gonna ruin anything for me actually I think spoilers to some degree kind of help the movie experience but I'm not gonna subject you guys do any of those so don't worry no spoilers on the way still waiting on film this is by no means a endorsement of Chipotle not normally abandon Chipotle but it's about all the Mexican we've got around here right now and I'm actually really genuinely super excited but that's it discovery could go they don't sell nachos here but that doesn't mean you can't try to make nachos happen remember being both better and worse than yeah just got a good 15 minutes to kill so we're gonna go try and find the skybridge up here which goes across to the other side and that's the whole story wanna ski the sky bridge final verdict Phil I liked it I needed dissect a little bit more but gotta let it digest I thought it was awesome I really yeah I enjoyed it I know now I have to wait two more years are you disappointed about oh I love that I can't now kill man but it just said about how much fun that movie was it was good I liked it I don't know why people are so controversial about it I mean I'm sure I could come up with reasons why but they're depressing so let's just enjoy it because it was a good movie
