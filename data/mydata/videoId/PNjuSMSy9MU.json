Because I've always wanted to. https://youtu.be/4Vivf6MqMxQ\n\nBut what are you doing there? https://youtu.be/ZW2RP--DO8Y\n\nDo you speak French? Oui.\n\nDo you make money off YouTube? Ha, no. I wish.\n\nCan I come stay with you in Paris? - Have you seen my apartment? It's too small for me as it is! https://youtu.be/6t2qj3rdyX8\n\nOK, but how do I use the Metro when I'm there?

I used that entrance to visit often during my first time in Paris in 1975, it was a lifesaver and no one seemed to know about it. Great guide here to getting in without the major tourist hassles and planning to avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of artifacts. <br /><br />The youth discount is available almost everywhere in the EU, but you need to ask for it and carry ID. Don&#39;t be put off by some museums that only discount to EU residents, they&#39;ll often extend the discount to others--including Americans--if the request is polite, includes a bit of local language (a &quot;bonjour,&quot; or a &quot;ya-sas&quot; will open many doors and discounts as long as your children are standing with you and well-behaved).<br /><br />My last visit to the Louvre was bringing the family in 2004 and our daughter wanted to see the Mona Lisa, which was directly up the stairs from the Pont de Lions entrance, looks like she&#39;s been moved to a much larger space. It was the first Sunday free entrance and it took all of 5 minutes to cruise in the Pont de Lions entrance while there were mile-long lines around the plaza waiting to enter through the I.M. Pei pyramid.",
			"textOriginal": "Ha-ha! You revealed the hushed Pont de Lions entrance. I used that entrance to visit often during my first time in Paris in 1975, it was a lifesaver and no one seemed to know about it. Great guide here to getting in without the major tourist hassles and planning to avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed by the sheer volume of artifacts. \n\nThe youth discount is available almost everywhere in the EU, but you need to ask for it and carry ID. Don't be put off by some museums that only discount to EU residents, they'll often extend the discount to others--including Americans--if the request is polite, includes a bit of local language (a \"bonjour,\" or a \"ya-sas\" will open many doors and discounts as long as your children are standing with you and well-behaved).\n\nMy last visit to the Louvre was bringing the family in 2004 and our daughter wanted to see the Mona Lisa, which was directly up the stairs from the Pont de Lions entrance, looks like she's been moved to a much larger space. It was the first Sunday free entrance and it took all of 5 minutes to cruise in the Pont de Lions entrance while there were mile-long lines around the plaza waiting to enter through the I.M. Pei pyramid.",
