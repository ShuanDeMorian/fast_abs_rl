 no where's Merlin now today's vlog day [Music] 864 four miles well 300 super miles shorter four miles that's neither here nor there happy post Thanksgiving Day everybody I guess that makes it Black Friday Black Friday's kind of catching on in France but you know it's not really the same thing either right if you celebrate Thanksgiving I hope you Thanksgiving was magnificent I'm going for Thanksgiving number two because as everybody continues to ask click or did ask yes people will be less curious for another year yeah uh but what do you do for Thanksgiving in Paris one is try to call but your own together with friends and the second is there are actually a handful of restaurants in town that do an American Thanksgiving and we're going to one tonight at 7 o'clock and I hope it's delicious I'm sure will be the show be great I am showered shaved and moisturized actually I don't know if I mentioned that many upstairs neighbor gave me a really nice facial moisturizer that I like never use so make sure to use that especially because after like brutalizing your skull for a minute your scalp it could use it i ok I'm wearing this for reason today like I said this Thanksgiving round number 2 will kind of focus on that I think a little bit this evening because I gotta get some work done and it feels good to have gone for a running gun and all that done but one of the things that one the service listen to I've been asked a lot about where to get Gustav's why in particular and you can't get the goose tough sticker this way but you can get all the other do stuff stuff in the shuffle oh I think if you go to the store I'm gonna I'm gonna re-release everything it's actually been available this whole time a couple people figured that out and managed to order something I never totally took them offline I just took them out of the main storefront if there's any shirt that you saw later that you wish would have had a chance to get or you got one didn't give another and whatever it is if you if you if you've been craving some gustav swag like a gustav mug which i love then i want to get enough these for myself I don't know why I need more than one beast um I got I probably shouldn't do that actually I don't have that much space in here but I'm gonna make it all active again on the web store with teespring if you want to go to that it's really neat that they unleash the shelf on my channel finally so I assume that's below go to it otherwise there's a link in the description and you can go grab if you wanted the heart face shirt if you wanted the big space invader if you wanted sannyas really cool design or my sister's awesome days of the week design that's on sale right now as well and in this Christmas sometime in December son is doing another awesome design of the Eiffel Tower and some Christmas lights which will be coming down the pipe shortly so if you're interested in any of those things now is your opportunity feel like there was one other thing that I needed to say with all of that Merry Christmas Happy Thanksgiving happy Black Friday something along those lines you know I hope you're having a great time I'm gonna get all that work that I was talking about though for now then we're going to make a quick delivery to Kate hopefully and then go you know have Thanksgiving around DOS because you can't only have one Thanksgiving and since we didn't make enough to have lots of leftovers we got to do it we got to do it this way and also because I wanted to experience it because I've never done a thing scheming in a restaurant before Trivandrum thing [Music] busses so miserably slow the one nice thing about Metro over buses among many is that metros don't get caught in traffic this the ride that I just took should take you 20 minutes in the sieve it took 45 minutes anyways I'm gonna pick up the stuff I need to pick up from Laura left overs for Kate because Kate didn't get a Thanksgiving dinner last night she was gonna be babysitting and no Thanksgiving happened it's a whole story but anyways I feel bad that she didn't get her Thanksgiving dinner so hooking her up with some leftovers especially because I'm getting to Thanksgiving dinners she's got to get at least one so pick that up drop it off running really late now hopefully I make it to dinner on time alright I got the goods I think I'm only gonna be about ten minutes late we'll find out [Music] Kate was very excited to get hurt they sushi she was she anyways time for Thanksgiving around 2:00 and then that's all I care about Jay [Music] this is really really good I never had Thanksgiving in courses before it's an interesting experience and I think I enjoy [Music] to your goal Pedro [Music] well that was delicious happy Thanksgiving let's get through here those guys were great it's a couple from New York who run the place as the names Sundays in Soho should be an obvious indicator of oh this is a great I used to be a great wine bar though that's close no that's too bad anyways lovely couple the food was amazing and they hadn't soured the head sour dough stuffing what what it was so good it was amazing I'd never even thought so if you ever want to make stuffing with sour dough I don't even really like sour dough highly recommended whole thing was really good super delicious had a great time they're lovely I really hope to get back in there and try their brunch they said that they're best known for their brunch so Saturdays and Sundays the new brunch they're not usually open for dinner but they did that a special Thanksgiving treat for all of us so Eileen Isabelle thank you so much for having us if you ever see this is delightful I'm forward to coming back at some point I now need to walk off this very full belly and then
