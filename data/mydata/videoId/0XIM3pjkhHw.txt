 blog in a 1004 no wonder I'm tired I need to go climb up a master something this is awful good morning it is I don't remember what - I don't know today it is Wednesday today is my fourth day of twenty and twenty it's gonna be kind of a weird one a little bit of a somber day because if you didn't catch it in the news yesterday the roof of Notre Dom burned the Attic burn threatened the whole church I have no idea what happened after we left it looked like they had the fire contained to the upper level and the hope is I was feeling fairly optimistic when I left that the stone structure was fine I was hearing a lot of reports about the art being evacuated the relics getting out and everybody was fine nobody was hurt I haven't looked at the news this morning I'm just gonna go straight down and see it for myself see what's going on because Nostradamus a part of the 4th - Ronnie's moat which is where I was gonna be today anyways timing feels eerie and yeah I'm kinda sad so kind of sad I'm sadder than I thought I was now that I'm talking about it definitely sadder than I thought it was but that entrance in the metro is closed we'll go over here I think I'll get out a total deville which is right across the river from Notre dumb and that's what we'll start this morning and we'll see where we go from there taking the long way around and want to see it from the front does either watch the channel regularly watch I don't know how many of you were just popping in to see this part know that I'm not at current events channel I'm a vlog I don't I don't know more than you know at this point you probably know more than I do actually but this church doesn't mean a lot to me personally [Music] looks like they've blocked off the bridge I don't think we're gonna be able to get very close to it today I'm gonna swing around I'll try to get over the next bridge over and see if I can't get a shot from the front here well yeah I'm still gonna get into the fourth today I'm definitely planning on showing you everything there is to see in the fourth for those of you in the future who think of this as long-lost history [Music] I definitely feel better seeing the church still standing I don't think we're gonna get very close they've got barricades set up on everything on every Bridge here the island is a whole might be shut off people are getting on but I think that people that work or live on the island well the start then this is the border of the 4th this bridge is open so I'm gonna pop over onto the island this is the very border of the fourth with the first the Conciergerie is in the first Nostradamus and the fourth the center of the city on Eire the West today which is where Paris was founded a long time ago and the church itself I mean it means a lots a lot of people for a lot of different reasons and for me a lot of it comes down it's just it's a it was always a like an awe-inspiring beautiful place but also something that was warm and familiar that when I first moved here I would just pop into whenever I could just just to see it just to walk through it just I don't know I felt a touch of history you feel a touch of awe you feel a touch of personal inspiration I don't know but I always really enjoyed just walking through it I would just go if I had 15 minutes and stroll through it just because I could because I was here because I really liked it I liked staring at all the details and kind of sussing out different things that I one of my favorite activities actually was always to sit directly in front of it and see if I could pick out all the details there are a lot of asynchronous elements to the front of the church so it's always fun to sit and see if I could spot all the differences all the unique little quirks about the construction of the church and I don't know it just feels kind of like yeah losing a friend or seeing a friend meems thankfully not not completely loosing it but see if this the first time I've seen it from the front so should this looks like [Music] okay first bit of good news though the Roseman does look like they might be okay there's not there's not busted out at least like the windows above them so that's nice okay that's the second best news the best news is that the church is still standing it hasn't collapsed itself it was just the roof it's not the original roof anyways and they saved a bunch of the statues from the renovations so hopefully that's good but the fact that the Rose window is still there thankfully ran into some friends last night found people to spend time with which was really good and some of these said that they saw the Rose window come out which would have been horrifying I mean those Rose windows they took all that stained glass out piece by piece to save it in World War two in case the church got bombs so to think that some schmuck like leaving a cigarette unattended or whatever happened I have no idea what caused this but you know would be the thing that took the Rose windows out would have been just horrifying all right I'll give you one last look here for those of you that are unfamiliar with the church this should all be covered by roof you should not be able to see the inside of that little triangle there and this should not be flat you can see will so I'll show you the other side the scaffolding is still it was still as in the shape of the roof [Music] well this definitely takes my complaints of scheduling issues this week to a completely different level I feel better seeing it standing and seeing the Rose window is still in place like oh my gosh basically feels so much better so much better I was gonna be so sad if the Rose windows were gone they're so beautiful I don't know what this means I don't know how long it'll be before we're allowed to go back inside I don't even know if they've completely they're still spraying water on it so I don't even know if they're there confident that they've finally put the fire out for good and I'm sorry to anybody that never made it in and that's that's just crazy maybe all these all these big news people's [Applause] and it's starting to rain so that's great we are now on L suddenly wheel suddenly is the smallest neighborhood they say in all of the city it doesn't have a bus or a metro you have to get onto it the good old fashioned ways preferably by horse or wheel as dictated by history the entire island this entire island is all forth all the time and has a fantastic view of notion on from behind which looks a little mangled now but he's still standing this is actually where I ended up last night during the livestream I stopped right at the top of that ramp back there and I mean we came back and watched again from across the way once I connected with the bike about people but just for some context if you're watching the livestream I was on ill something we'd to end and I started over at Hotel de Ville so there's a little bit of that I'm gonna get off the bumpy road and away from the crowds here for a minute one thing I'll show on Ilsan Louie feels so weird to be doing this today is Bertie on Bertie on is the most famous ice cream in the city and there are some giant tubes in my way much bigger problem for the guys on scooters that are trying to turn right right now Bert Co is the most famous ice cream in the city some would say it's the best ice cream in the city but they definitely have the classiest main store in the city and of course there's a bunch of this fire truck parked right in front of it so Bert - y'all don't look for the fire truck hopefully it's still not still here by the time you get here if you're gonna come visit it's really tasty if there is a fire truck parked in front of it don't worry their ice cream is sold everywhere on the island and where you see that fancy B or the word Bertie on you'll be able to find it you don't have to go to the main store but the main store is super worth it all right let's bounce off the island it definitely peloton it's not open yet but come on I want I need coffee and a waffle would be really nice right not too [Music] the jackhammering is not helping I'm not sure what all I lost on the audio side because I didn't have my microphone on but this is st. Paul st. Paul is the church that was built by louis xiii for the jesuit so it's a very different Church than any of the other churches in town and it has to be beautiful inside Lord never been inside I found Laura by the way missed that part because the audio is dead but anywho it's a wonderful Church it's often open on new we've launched it's a very lovely quiet inside and again really different with some lofty rounded arches just make it kind of special and if you go straight down the street away from it you get a fantastic photo of it as well but speaking of getting great photos there's one more spot that I wanted to hit while we were down here before we go and get waffles and coffee because I don't yeah let's just get out of here before the jackhammer kills us all [Music] Plus TiVo is the oldest planned square in Europe royal housing back in the day it's the most expensive real estate in all of Paris currently but I'm sure a couple of exceptions along the way because there's always exceptions to every rule this place is amazing it's not only beautiful like the houses are all uniform you have these delightful colonnades which will take advantage up for just a second I'm talking about it just look at this but it also has this delightful park in the middle I highly recommend grabbing some gelato around the corner right where we entered heading into the park sunbathing not today with the rain it's obviously not a good day for it but Park is a great spot to sit and it's one of the few places in Paris where you're actually allowed to hang out on the grass most of the time you have to wait oh we're past it the 15th of April look at that no today people we're already doing it though but technically you're allowed to get on the grass now which is great I don't know how much I'm allowed to ride my wheel in here but [Music] Vasanta lesson a Luthor or the the basin of the Arsenal is the beginning of canal Samata so it's loaded with boats that are parked here a lot of which are headed on their way up the canal some of which might be here more permanently but a lot of these people are actually travelling through Paris on their boat just kind of a cool way to travel makes me wish I had a boat but it was building by Napoleon to separate the rich from the poor it was built as a dividing line between classes but also brought fresh water to the city and commerce and if you were to jump on one of these boats and use the canal you'd be able to go all the way into Germany I'd actually know where it ends but theoretically you'd be able to get to Germany then switch to the Danube and make your way down to the Mediterranean that's what I've been told I've never done it myself but someday maybe I'll get to you'll also see a structure that you might recognize it's a really tall tower that marks where the besty prison used to be which was a castle to begin with and then was turned into a political prison and then was torn down during the revolution and now is a terrible roundabout that's been under construction for forever don't drive through there right now it's that's the worst [Music] all right I believe we've officially earned a waffle it's time to go back to the peloton and get some office and copier here [Music] good to get a little bit of a waffle and coffee in me Rena head over to what I think is the most underrated building in the city I would tell deville maybe Tristan Jack and then lunch in the Marais the Marais one of the things that I haven't said about the Marais yet just said about the open array yesterday is that it is famous for its shopping as well if you want to do some shopping you like the little boutiques want to get some clothes even some knickknacks or collectibles it's a wonderful place for it not my favorite or Ronnie's not for food but I'm gonna show you the number one recommendation that I have for the neighborhood and one of my biggest recommendations for food in Paris is where we're gonna go for lunch but first hotel de ville and tourists on Jack [Music] getting some panoramic Rishon footage of the villa is the nearest office of all of Paris there is a mayor's office in every Rani's month we actually just passed mayor's office of the forth around these months not necessarily that interesting but this thing is as old as no true Dom it's been built on over the years so not all of it is but Hotel de Ville the mayor's office has been here for a very very long time it's a phenomenal building I think it's one of the most underrated buildings in the city just doesn't get enough love gorgeous and it's right next to notre Dom which looks so weird without her roof this looks so strange [Music] dorsen Jacque is the church that was a church that's no longer a church it is just a tower suffered the fate that thankfully no true Dom avoided yesterday it was torn down during the revolution and they just left this one tower up which is now in the middle of a park and you can only go up in the summer in small groups I've never done it I really want to do it this year because I'm sure the view was amazing really I would really like to climb up that tower so this is the year one last thing that's famous in the fourth that deserves a mention before we go to lunch is Pompey do the sons of Pompey do is the famous National Arts Museum and right next to it of course is the Stravinsky fountain [Music] I used to really dislike this museum it stands out in a bad way in Paris it's not that it's necessarily that horrifying on its own in context being in Paris is kind of a rough spot to have it it is admittedly pretty hideous but the same time has one of the nicest views in the city if you go up to the top so a fantastic view among the rooftops of the forth around these model so there is some great shopping around here lots of lots of space invaders you know lots to wander around and see now that we've been here and seen it time for lunch just down here our final stop today is on the famous hue of oza is a great little walking district with crepes falafel and a number of different recommendations that I have in my guide including the most popular most famous falafel spot in all of Paris lost a falafel which is very good I think Shay Hanna's actually even better just depends on what you prefer if you don't like aubergine if you don't like eggplant and lasted falafels probably for you [Music] battery's about to die so I'll leave you with the beef bourguignon Kishan got the ratatouille what did you get Laura that's all you got to get a simmer oh you're good you've had two breakfasts today you said how's the ratatouille we good yeah like it I don't know I'm gonna love the bringing on so hop mmm hope you've enjoyed this quick tour through the fourth in the Marais and I hope that you have a wonderful day where it is you are and I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for another round of the 20 and 20 which I didn't explain at all today that's okay just go watch yesterday's you'll get a good explanation [Music]
