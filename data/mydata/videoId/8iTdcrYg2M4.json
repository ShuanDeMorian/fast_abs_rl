But not too badly - I tend to be careful when I do.\n\nWhy are you living in #Paris? - Because I've always wanted to; I feel at home here: https://youtu.be/4Vivf6MqMxQ\n\nDo you speak French? Oui. https://youtu.be/va1QjaHgij8\n\nYou talk a lot about the books you're working on, what are they about? - They're sci-fi (and fantasy) and I've got a decent pitch for you here: https://youtu.be/W2bKt4_Tp4E\n\nDo you make money off YouTube? - Ha, no. I wish. It took me over 500 videos to make my first total $100 off adsense. I think it will slowly change, but VERY slowly.\n\nI really enjoy your videos, how can I support you? - The easiest and best way to support me is through Patreon, where you can pitch in as little as $1/mo to help me make better videos: http://patreon.com/jayswanson\n\nI don't trust this Patreon thing - can I just paypal you? - Here's my ko-fi if that's your thing (and coffee is your game): https://ko-fi.com/jayswanson\n\nBut I want to send you something tangible! - I do have a wishlist on Amazon, though it's a bit complicated with the international shipping situation.

The bike can then be used as a hobby horse or scooter, with the feet always ready to stop a fall.</i>  <i>--Sheldon Brown</i><br /><br />     <a href=\"https://www.sheldonbrown.com/teachride.html\">https://www.sheldonbrown.com/teachride.html</a>",
					"textOriginal": "I spent time with someone who was just learning to ride a bicycle at age 35 (they succeeded, immediately).\n        If you decide to try this, stay off the front brake entirely, at first - just use your rear brake.\n\n        When you're ready to ride faster than you can run (or maybe a bit slower than that, but well above walking speed) you'll need to know how to use the front brake (if there is one).\n        Before riding in traffic (with cars) it's important to learn to ride very slowly .. hopefully, slower than walking speed, without putting your feet down.\n        But that's advanced; on a bicycle, it's not (at all) like standing on one foot (without a bike).  It's not that kind of balancing.\n       It's the kind of balancing you do on two feet. ;)\n\n       Only, the bike has to be in motion.\n       It works for pretty much the same reason a broom held (upside down) on a fingertip, at the end of the handle, balances.\n       It's an inverted pendulum.\n\n        *   *   *\n\n      _The ideal bike for learning to ride, whether for a child or a deprived adult, is a bike that is \"too small\" for efficient riding. For learning purposes, the rider should be able to sit on the saddle with both feet flat on the ground and the knees slightly bent. The bike can then be used as a hobby horse or scooter, with the feet always ready to stop a fall._  _--Sheldon Brown_\n\n     https://www.sheldonbrown.com/teachride.html",
