That is Western hunter gatherers, Early European Farmers and Aryans. Due to the ways in which these groups (who all were originally one group if you trace their migrations back far enough) migrated into Europe you will find more Aryan DNA in the north of Europe and More Early European Farmer DNA in the south. Every European [Including the British] is made from the DNA of these 3 groups. In later periods of history we know that the Romans settled Britain for a while and while they did not leave too much DNA behind they left the foundations for civilization in the form of towns that would go on to become some of the islands largest cities including LONDON. Later some German trouble makers came in and set up operations leaving a large chunk of DNA and a royal family, also sadly ensuring that the islands culture would be more of a Germanic rather than Latin based culture but much of the original celtic culture still remains which is very nice.
