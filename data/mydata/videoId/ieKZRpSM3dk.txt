 like at a 10/10 and I feel like I'm in shadow get somebody please somebody please move that son I need better lighting good morning and welcome to day 10 of my 20 and 20 here in Paris what is this 2020 you might not be asking anymore hopefully you've been watching these but what I'm doing for 2020 is basically going to each and every year from these Mon in Paris one after the other in sequential order starting in the first and making my way out to the 20th as I go today I'm in the 10th each and every arrondissement in Paris comes with its associated name the districts remember it makes it kind of handy today I'm jumping into the 10th like I said and you'll see in the southwestern sections of the tent these arches these old doorways there are a couple of them meeting up roof fabric some old town and a couple of others normally if you see one of these and you walk north you're gonna find some good night life as well as some tasty food during the day and directly south of me you go straight straight there you're gonna go back to the 3rd but that's where bon Esprit is and they're one of the waypoints for the game good to know I'm gonna walk you to Oney right now which is in the game but I'm afraid is closed today because they're pretty much always closed on Mondays and if you've been following along you know that Mondays and Sundays are not good day is to make sure that the place you want to go her open and this is an Easter Monday which makes it even less likely to the places I want to go we're gonna be open but we're still gonna find a bunch because the 10th may not have a lot going on as far as touristy stuff goes there's one really cool site that I highly recommend you go and check out but aside from that it's just food and there's a lot of food it is definitely one of the best around these months for food if not the best Ronnie's not for food and so even with all the closures today still a high likelihood that I will be pressed to make any decisions on what I actually want to eat today because they're gonna be a lot of options so let's get started [Music] like I said oneís a fantastic spot for coffee brunch and very work friendly really love those guys they're also in the game missing their sticker I think their sticker got stolen by the side that they should have the stickers you need if you're trying to collect stickers so definitely give them a try tomorrow or by the time you've seen this video they should be open so that's handy for you guys I guess just not handy for me I'm gonna walk up here and on the way I'm gonna debate and decide let's we can go look at reppu bleak really quickly because the tent includes like the northwestern half of republika square itself you know take a look at that and then debating whether to try Halle belly or go straight up the street of coffee mecca in the tenth figure this out also for those of you there's a lot to talk about today but first for those be missing the wheel ITIL missing the wheel but I thought I'd give it a break today give my legs a little bit of a stretch and I'm already missing it cuz it's just so much faster and give all ready be wherever I want to go right now if you have a skateboard and you want to test it out this is not a bad spot to do it so from bonne nouvelle down to here the the street changes name is basically with every metro station so it's like boulevard summer tom boulevard bundy Velva it's it's impossible to keep track of all the names of this it's just one long street it's also loaded with nightlife not a bad spot to go if you want to get out and mingle drink a little bit it's pretty good that's like the exact opposite of what I want to do right now I want to sit down and eat something and have some coffee so I'm gonna make my way over towards Holly belly which really needs no introduction it's probably the best brunch in the city it's phenomenal I'm gonna get there savory stack it has like a bourbon butter on it that makes all the difference and their coffee is very good as well and then we're just gonna go for a stroll from there and I'll show you that one thing that I recommend that you see is you get a photo of while you're here or have a picnic next to while you're here so probably I don't know what it is and we'll also have a guest today that I know a number of you are probably missing so there'll be a nice little update there as well but for the moment all I care about is the food [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there's almost always a line at Holly belly but it is completely worth it I don't even like pancakes and I would eat their pancakes every day probably for the rest of my life if I could but I cannot afford to get that fat I'm already getting too fat walking around eating so much food this week I'm gonna go find our special guest for today hope you're excited and then it's time to go check out the canal which the tent has probably the most popular section of the canal or the most famous section of the canal I don't know I think all the most popular because the section of the canal in the nineteenth is very very heavily used by the locals actually the nineteenth might be more heavily used than the tenth now that I think about it that'd be an interesting statistic to look up I should be rolling right now I should be flying on my wheel so let's go find our guests and then let's check out [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] our dessert looks like it's closed today on Easter Monday and there are two French restaurants that I was really wanted to hit you know wine and charcuterie places one that's on the canal and one that's closer to république both of which are closed today unfortunately so for lunch after we're going to a dog park that should be really fun after the dog park I think I might get a shwarma and show you a spot that's in the game whether or not we end up getting the shroom I'll show you it's right next to here and this area has got tons of coffee when I said that there was a coffee mecca street in this neighborhood it's this street basically you have multiple places that are in my guide and on my master just straight up the street but if you don't hit up one of these few places right next to us you can always go all the way up to Fontaine de Belleville which is a really fantastic old-school feeling Brasserie that's run by Belleville which is one of the largest Roasters in Paris and well worth a visit all of that available obviously where I've been saying all week but what is not in my guide and you want to get the experience yes sir oh yeah there's a space invader over there get a catch you want to make sure you get those little ones yes do that one and you see the one way down there there's another big one you kind of have to come over here to see it see it right go right by the tabac big one it's the flash the duck park not in my guide but I'm sure that if you wander along the canal you be able to find it on your own [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Gustav's a little bit aggressive with the other dogs when it comes to protecting the water but he's learning I had to tackle him once and I think he's been tackled a few times since Gustav handsome little man proud little man - okay so from here I think we're gonna end up either at schwarmann from here or we'll see if richard has another suggestion I'm definitely gonna show you karla t-bone they are in the game if you don't know I'm time I wanna talk about the game make sure you're head of travel unlock calm check that out for the time being it's an analog treasure hunt basically go collect stickers as you go to great places along the way maybe get bonuses from them as well as well as collecting additional stickers and then turning everything in for points at the end to trade in for postcards all of that on the website go check out the website it's time for it's it's getting close to lunchtime [Music] come buddy bail one of the best aromas in the city top three for sure my favorite there's one that I've heard is is even better that I haven't tried yet so I'll let you know once I do but they are in the game right next to the canal what we're gonna do is grab a shawarma and then go sit by the canal and enjoy the sunshine and I'm not gonna go for fries today because I definitely have prep I've had enough fries recently for sure but they'll hook you up with some body if you're playing the game they'll hook you up with something additional if you buy the the sandwich fries in the drink they'll give you a bonus you see my face on the window charlie so full disclosure there was a child related accident so new pants are being purchased and we're we're instead of eating on the canal which was the plan I was rat I would love to eat on the canal right now it's a perfect canal eating whether well we'll eat here in république after the pants are purchased and that'll be it for today I hope you really enjoyed today's wander through the tent like I said there's not a ton to look at let's go to the canal in which case go watch a boat move its way through the locks and that's the way to spend a lot way too much time just kind of sitting around watching the world go by and otherwise just eat I mean you could you could spend a week just in the tent and not even come close to scratching the surface on how much good food is here hope you have a wonderful day wherever it is you are and I'll see you bright and early tomorrow for hopefully a robust and full Tuesday without the holiday season kicking us out see you tomorrow [Music] [Music] you
