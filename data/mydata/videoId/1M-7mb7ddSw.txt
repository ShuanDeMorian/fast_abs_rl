 oh hey hey it's bogging a 670 in case you were curious [Applause] [Music] new flowers going in good morning it is Friday for you it's Thursday for me but that means it's French Friday and today I thought let's go on a bike tour I used to do by tourists here in Paris last traded by tours I'm still buddies with the guys who run the bike tours I thought I'd share them with you because they're unique they're definitely a more fun version of a bike tour if you want to do one here in Paris because they get to see kind of the behind the scenes of Paris do you see some of the bigger stuff still but you get to go see some smaller side streets get some fun history they're really in fun tours and I'm not gonna be doing as many this summer as I did last summer but at the same time that doesn't mean that I don't think you should do them and so if you're gonna come to Paris doing a bike to earth bike about tours I definitely think is one of the number one things you could be doing with your time when you get here now the thing about doing a bike tour with bike about tours will get on the bikes you're here in a second you'll get to see it will right around the city it's about three and a half hours and I highly recommend that you do it right off the bat the reason I think you should do it the first thing is because it gives you a good sense of the city gives you a good sense of the scale of the city the walkability of the city if you want to rent a bike helps you feel confident in riding a bike in the city but it also gets you like oriented but gives you a good sense of like okay here's where things are I can get around this place I know what's going on let's do this definitely thing I think you should do at the very beginning of your time in Paris [Music] the bikes are actually kept in this parking garage which is that one of the great mysteries when you when you show up you think oh man all the bikes are gonna be sitting out on top of no turned on they're not they're just next door and you I can you get them look at there I just thought I'd show you this since I'm already over here right now they've got seven years so without does really matter because it's a flat city but you've got two hills on the whole course and one of them was just getting out there is an adult Tama if you really feel the need it's the best part so they'll bring you down here get the bikes and take you upstairs like I said this is the only Hill on the course so so once you've popped up stairs normally you have space to test your bike out up here but they're currently making a movie of some sort this is also a common area a staging area for films so you never know who you're gonna see you saw Tom Cruise here last year a couple times that was fun safety briefing by that so it's all is gonna be the guide today I'll do a little bit of a safety briefing here so I'll kind of preview what its gonna have on the tour and it's gonna be fun for me because she's gonna go a different route than I normally go there's like two routes you can go it's kind of like flipping a figure eight I always go the backwards way so I'm actually looking forward to seeing what the normal route looks like it's been a long time since I've taken it and yeah here we go [Music] I'm in case you're wondering are not legally required if you are above the age of 12 I think in France so I'm not wearing one cells not wearing one but some of them wanted to wear them and so that's an option you can actually get a bike helmet while you're here as well [Music] and the nice thing is that she's gonna stop and give speeches every once in a while oh one of the reasons I want to make this video is because you've asked me a lot of questions about how the bike tour actually goes and a lot of people think that you just ride like hardcore just never stop and like she like well shouts tour is that you which is not the case at all actually it's nice is you stopped regularly here's some stories and then move on from there it's really easy as just you'll see we're mostly in bike lanes occasionally on the road sometimes back alleys it's really safe really easy to do flat city it's a lot of fun anyways she's gonna be telling them another story I want to miss and I'm not gonna give away all the good stories you got to come do the tour to get the stories but you know ones like this Hotel de salsa it's the oldest mansion of its kind in the city also here comes a car I better [Music] I jumped ahead just so we could be alone for a minute if you follow my vlog at all you'll know that there are space invaders all around the tour and I love is very there's one just right here on the corner when you go into plastic bows keep your eye out for this guys the red guy on the corner right next to Cafe Hugo ten points right there if you've got the flashing banner is that this area plastic voters just famous as being like the most expensive part of the city to live in and there are some really fun stories with it so when you come here there are couple different cool things here that you can see but even if you don't come here on a bike tour it's a great spot to do a little bit of sunbathing in the middle it's the only park in the city where you actually get to sit on the grass all the time some good ice cream next door just go sit in the middle sunbathe pretty fantastic anyways tours going great and the weather is perfect we're entering like the peak season to be out on a bike right now so definitely I'm enjoying this it's kind of fun to be on the tour instead of leaving the tour for once I don't know definitely saving my voice at least [Music] all right just make sure that you remember to look behind you at least for a minute [Music] there's another space invader here under the bridge with Saint Genevieve the statue not gonna shut to you though you got to get it yourself [Music] there are a couple of spots along the way where you can fill up water bottles so if you want to carry water bottle with you no guarantees you're gonna get a basket you know bring a backpack just in case but I that's another thing actually to be aware of this some people aren't for whatever reason you're gonna be out of bicycle for three three and a half hours if you can't carry it with you don't bring it fair I think fair advice we're about to see one of the old water fountains here in the city where you can fill up your water and then there's also a snack break halfway through so depending which guide you have and which route you take your snack break might be in a different spot but I believe today we're gonna be stopping on Rue de Buci fantastic spot for a snack so that'll be a that's actually coming up shortly but first ill de este [Music] I blog before so this is fresh drinking water if you get thirsty when you're walking around town they're a whole lot of these around and there are it gets technically three on the tour but two of them are in the same spot now it's not running for everything mosquito [Music] so snack time like 15-20 minutes stop have a snack find a toilet get a coffee that kind of thing and then back on the bikes and on we go [Music] of course the wind kicks up round I decided to talk it was fine until the second ago it's really interesting to see where she stops different guides stop at different places in the Louvre but riding through the Louvre is one of the best parts of this whole thing and the secret tunnel which I'm not gonna show you how to get into but hopefully I have enough battery life of my phone to show you when we get there a really good tour all the tour guides with Mike about her a lot of fun it's a beautiful day and this is the first time I've seen the fountains on this year so that's kind of cool to see the fountains on finally anyways if you're gonna come to Paris and you want to do something outdoors and you've got four hours to kill definitely do one of the bike tours you'll learn something you'll see something you've never seen before you wouldn't have found on your own and it's a really really good way like I said earlier to get oriented to the city so definitely do this first thing when you come to Paris how do they highly recommend it anyways back on the bikes [Music] the secret tunnel one of the best parts of the tour I love going through that tunnel so much is actually really nice break I hope you enjoyed the tour but a little bit you saw definitely take this if you come to Paris highly recommended obviously full disclosure I worked at them last year so kind of working with them lightly this year and if you do both be sure to let them know that you found them through me and they'll actually hook you up with one of the heart face stickers I can't really show you a hard face sticker Nolan writing that'd be dangerous but they'll hook you up with a heart face sticker if you don't want you can also obviously just go into the peloton and pick one up and buy a coffee they're in there for sale as well but you get one for free if you do it tours so might as well do that grab a sticker and yeah if you're lucky maybe I'll be the tour guide that week I don't know I think I'm gonna do a few this week this year and I'll just keep it a secret when I'm gonna do them and we'll figure out how that goes anyways hope you enjoyed this if you haven't

actually I've we're done afterward let's go to lunch alright post bike tour summary of the day I was at the peloton all morning that Pat was really nice really nice to meet you she brought me beer I can show you the beer that she brought me which was lovely bringing me my Grob brews from around the world this is definitely a way to win my friendship I'm having lunch at this place a new burger joint just down the street hold on let's go outside and try this [Music] let's not let you know how it is and I'm gonna go to the bike tour and you know it goes on from there this place was good the fries were like perfectly cooked not quite as salty as I like but I like absurdly salty stuff you know what that honk is about anyways I also went to lomography and got the prints on camera four so I have the prints of camera four although it doesn't matter if you haven't seen already you can download the digital scans of these prints from disposable camera four and snag them on Gumroad for five bucks right do whatever you want with them from there so anyways I'm gonna turn on the turn now I have a phone call for work after that and I'm gonna go see Deadpool too and I think that'll be it for the day hopefully we enjoy the bike tour because I haven't gotten there yet but you've already seen it so you know had time work summers back in Paris I didn't record I tried to record the people out having delicious beers on the side of the river because it's what I want to be doing right now but guess who's phone's about to die and I couldn't see and apparently didn't actually start recording anyways I'm having a grand old time it felt like winter this morning but it's back to summer now and I'm happy for it there are a couple of new space invaders down here on the river as well since I've been tantalizing you with space invaders today so do make sure to find those I'm gonna show you okay you know what you know where I'm at right now the bridge I'm going under is not the bridge with the space from Vader on it the one after it is how about that for a hint anywho the movie is movie was good it was not nearly as good as the first which I guess it's to be expected but they did a better job of pulling a film together out of that than I expected to be honest so that time you haven't subscribed yet please do subscribe I gotta cross the street before the car hits me and let's kiss bright and early tomorrow morning again for more whatever badness my life turns into on Friday in Paris
