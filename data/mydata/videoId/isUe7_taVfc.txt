fact they don't speak English well yeah whoo everything who's working in an information booth he said he can't speak English only French so that's very unfortunate because I can understand her so great right look at that side of my brain and it even says hello in different languages maybe it's just really lazy okay my tickets ticket first one just one two three yeah my old fare oh yeah it's 12 euros by one to get one trip is 1.9 euros and since we're going around Cuddy's for the whole day and it's been raining we decided to buy the one who'll day ticket which cost us 12 euros only included four nine one two three the first stop a lot of people the subway station is connected to the carousel and yeah you see the huge queue over there it's because there's a line and there and I need to check your bag if in case you guys have something illegal or sharp I didn't know I have a meet-and-greet today okay but that's my parents lined up for me this is a long queue what is this board and we are about to find out eating a little bit I think it's the line to enter the museum so Wow okay so this is good buy the tickets we didn't do the tickets online you need to fall in line one hour later finally you got our ticket after waiting for so long now we're going to enter and we see you this is another part of the museum as you can see that's the outside it's so much prettier outside but we're gonna check that one out later when it's not raining funny I don't you just hate it when people sneeze and they do cover their their mouth is I do it you germs you're spreading your germs all over get them out you should find this with you information and just go get a map preferably on your language for us English oh there's also built up Russian spy each other we just need one I don't want to waste too much because probably we're going to throw this afterwards I guess we're going to see Monday Mesa first but the entrance fee for the museum de Loup we see you is 15 euros and if you want an audio guide its additional 5 euros but for us I think we good with just yeah yeah you just decided did there any a few minutes ago that we're going to see it because I want to see Mona Lisa she's seen it before I didn't have it and you know what I'm in Paris so might as well right I'm not much of an art thief unlike my sister I know she's going to love it here [Music] the moment that we've all been waiting for you guys have never seen so many cameras taking a photo one meeting they quite a lot normally they take photos of the celebrities but this one they take photos of a painting I can't even see it you guys [Music] this is the real deal before that's how far I am you know what they say patience is a virtue okay just gonna wait again in line just to see the Mona Lisa I've traveled all the way from the Philippines just to see this so might as well right I'm doing this not just for me but also for you guys okay again we are seeing it back seemi baaji drama in it man minutes so in the air yet so far excuse me sir put their hope is yes [Music] m'lila braved the crowd just for you guys for the world and also it's nice to see it from up close and appreciate it see how many people there is no queue I wish there was well there was kind of a cute but not really some people are pushing each other in is not good I think the reason why there's also a lot of people inside this museum it's because it's been raining the whole the back three days so they wanted to come here instead of doing the activities outside we were going to excess door a little bit more of this wish you but seeing a lot of people is exhausting Oh Julia good vibes Ola [Music] that's the cue to enter they meet you not the ticket so if I were you here's a tip go inside the train station enter from yet the subway done outside because I think there's more people lined up outside it's not even a weekend it's only the Wednesday imagine if it's a weekend for sure the line is longer it takes so much time for you guys to enter you so we went outside the Museo and a couple of what do you call them not happen guy yeah African guys were selling these key chains ask and we have a ticket to the museum and we were like yeah we still have it and he said he's going to trade it for this so now we have some souvenirs this area because you know normally if you're near the tourist spots you also get a tourist price this is the entrance to the museum again it's better if you take the subway entrance than this one because here you have to stay outside in the cold sometimes it's raining [Music] [Applause] [Music] id3 oh yeah Staubach it's bigger than the one in Barcelona darkness is there to know why but it's so nice although it's raining the you have to exit the subway station Arc de Triomphe it's quite easy understand especially if you use Google Maps Google Maps doesn't sponsor me oh I hate just that you guys know but I highly to chance for you guys to download it because it saves a lot of time and it's so efficient and convenient for us travelers not if you don't need try energy French Mikado let's go [Music] got ourselves are really expensive oh my gosh I won't be able to eat until I leave Europe because this food is a box for six pieces is 17.5 euros you see that big power thing behind me that is the Eiffel Tower like I made it here yeah and we're so lucky you got the sky starting to clear up you wanted to go I don't think it'd hear me it's pretty witty but we want to go up the Eiffel Tower they said it's worth it to see the whole patties but you know what I think I'm ok with this I'm gonna appreciate it the beauty of it moldable from afar never really had to get somebody out of me I don't know [Music] we are tired and hungry she did a lot of shopping
