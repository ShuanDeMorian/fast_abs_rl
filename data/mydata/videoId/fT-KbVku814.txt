 I still don't know what this symbol means Matt's okay because it's boggidy 627 good morning it's I got into this way too fast and forgot what day was Wednesday and today my dad is in town which is pretty exciting I'm also wearing the shirt that I got from Simon it's basically a t-shirt which is very own brand thank you very much it's medium apparently I am still a large getting close though I was actually like myself in the mirror like it almost fits it's kind of crazy to see like how much weight I've lost I did weigh myself yesterday and I'm done 198 so we're headed back in the right direction slowly but definitely headed the right direction Gallup which is kind of encouraging but thank you again for the shirt it's nice and soft it feels good it's just a little bit small so yeah people have learned something today I wondered I I didn't know if I could fit into a medium I technically can I don't know you guys let me know does it fit how does it look is this something that I should avoid is it too tight I will take your feedback in comments below please please be nice I'm gonna go meet my dad he just landed which is really exciting I'm gonna meet him for coffee with you're good just in case like I was up working super late I actually got a good night's sleep I got my edit dum a little bit early and felt overwhelmingly tired and went to bed and I think I got like 10 hours of sleep maybe more like nine but still it's about a minute so nice amount of sleep have a little care package you need to make for my dad we're gonna go meet him and then we'll figure out what we're doing from there until he can give in to his Airbnb also need a lot of the flowers lots going on [Music] never forgot the care package whoops I did give it an Easter card for my grandma's oh thank you grandma that's very nice of you [Music] I would expect him to be here by now his flight was a little bit delayed that landed at 8:25 sells like two and a half hours ago should it take two and a half hours to get here from the airport I think so hopefully he's okay I hope there he is [Music] [Music] we had a tasty picnic lunch because it's picnicky weather she's great who's gonna ask how you feeling sleepy yeah mostly awake hopefully well partially awake so I'm walking him to blue a leaf which is another one of my favorite coffee spots over here I don't think he's gonna have coffee but I'm gonna have coffee hopefully we get into his Airbnb soon should be good but I'm still waiting on that so just enjoying the weather while we can there's a twofer right there right outside the Alma Paloma or the metro station didn't know those were there we made it to the Airbnb but apparently their whole system is automated they didn't send us anything but a quick phone call and they've sent it to us look at this I have a phone this is fun I don't get to have my phone in anything anyways side note so we have all the codes we need we'll go inside and check it out home sweet home not bad there was no fob left where they told us there would be one somebody might've stolen it or they didn't put it back so we had to sneak in behind a very nice lady who let us in and now we're just waiting to get instructions on that boat we got the key you've got a nice big bed you got more space than I have but more water scenes and I have to so you know it's true my rent is much cheaper we are out and walking to keep this one awake a little bit longer so we're gonna go look at motorcycles just around the corner because you know that's a good way to stay awake and then hopefully the guy shows up with the fob around 5:30 so we can actually it back in the building then dinner and then he's going to bed then I got worked fun times but hey here's the Arc de Triomphe showing my dad there is Indian motorcycles there Ducati yeah he's sure Suzuki a bunch of random specialty shops in New York triumph yeah we just walked by a vintage replace and then there's I'm pretty sure the Royal Enfield is up here and then there's a triumph store around you're super my should be down there so just thought we'd go look at motorcycles and drool for a minute torture ourselves a touch now that we're done looking at stuff we can't afford gonna go ahead and go back to my place I'll do a little bit of voice acting stuff while he tries to stay awake and then get him into his place hopefully into the Airbnb and from there dinner and then you can finally go to bed like yeah that's probably the things this is the thing he's looking forward to the most I'm sure I want to go to bed I'm not I haven't got a good night's sleep [Music] [Music] alright managed to get that recorded just in time for this guy to show up with the fob hopefully I don't know if I have that I have ups for him I'm carrying my dad's ridiculously heavy backpack this thing is a monster no wonder he's tired drop that off get some dinner put him to bed get some sleep right easy enough well Airbnb is kind of complicated final story is that whoever stayed here last inflicted some damage on the bathroom so it leaked and then they just didn't realize that it broke in the circuit so we have to leave the circuit broken for 24 hours poor guy it's time and then they also we still don't have a way of getting into the building well I sort of do he showed us a hack to get in which I'm not gonna share with you because definitely a security flaw out of the building but but yeah we ever way of hacking our way in until you can get us a replacement fob tomorrow one of those situations this is one of those like where you're like what does the downside to using your B&B sometimes is that there's really no recourse for this but he was a nice enough guy so it's not a big deal he was very nice you're you're dying aren't you so close we'll get some pizza and him and then I'll leave him to his slow jet laggy death I know is overall was a really good day I think I'm gonna end it pretty much here got him into the Airbnb it's all squared away it's it's nice enough and we'll get some pizza and then I will edit my vlog and maybe get one more good night's sleep myself and hopefully tomorrow I'll be rested and ready to tackle Paris with the Nils Swanson nice [Music]
