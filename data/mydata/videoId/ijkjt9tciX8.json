It&#39;s not a huge deal if you order one in the afternoon, but it&#39;s just not what they do. 2) Pedestrians in Italy are considered a blood sport! It took me 2 weeks to learn how to cross the street properly, which is basically, cross with conviction! Do not hesitate and do not show fear. I remember in Rome, I would make direct eye contact with the drivers as I was walking passed them. 3) Rejoice vegans and non-dairy people! Italy has LOADS of gelato without milk in it! Here in Canada, the gelato stores usually have just 4-6 non-dairy flavours and then there&#39;s like 30 flavours or more in the dairy selection. The gelateria in Italy have a seriously good selection of non-dairy flavours including many in chocolate. Yes, this is heaven.",

We were cycling all across the country and as much as it was, like you said- stunning, we were also in great danger, having our bags in the back of our bikes. We were easily visible to others and unfortunately we experienced terrible situation as well. They ganged up on us and tried to take our bags of our bikes. I was screaming and making a scene in beautiful Florence. We succeeded to push them away somehow and fight for our stuff! ..but what they took was our feeling of safety.. The fear of it happening again still lives inside of us and we are trying to overcome it and let go though it&#39;s challenging. Whenever we travel, that feeling of being a pray is present.. it needs more time to heal. <br />I am proud of you dealing with your experience in such a lovely way- being open and vulnerable about it.. your strength shines!

Things could get very expensive, so shop around and compare prices as you go.On the whole, I enjoyed the experience, and found the none tourist areas were the most relaxing and more down to earth than the tourist spots.Rome lit up by night is fantastic, and so beautiful.
