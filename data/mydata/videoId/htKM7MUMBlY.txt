 be hooked so we vlog yet did vlog in a 976 good morning it's Tuesday in Paris and I'm going to go for a long bike ride with my buddy Christian actually there are two things that are happening today two very distinct and unique experiences for me today I'm gonna be recreating the route that I've done a couple of times is by Metro but I wanted to show you how to get up by bike as well if you are ever interested in renting a bike while you're in Paris and the Christian is gonna share a couple of tips and pointers about staying safe while riding your bike in Paris there are a couple of tricks rules and laws that make your time a lot more pleasant while you're riding and then this evening I don't know if you remember the oh my milk extravaganza it barely made it in my vlog really but it was quite the experience but I'm by the milk and cheese producers at France I got to go eat a crap ton of cheese it was some of the best cheese of my life and they've invited me for like a private dinner tonight and that I am I'm super excited about so I'm gonna earn my delicious private chef dinner by burning a whole bunch of calories on a bike today that's the summary but first we need to ingest a few calories so let's start off with some coffee and a waffle because that sounds delicious right where I left you [Music] are you ready Christian for the ride of your life if you don't know Christian already Christian is one of the proprietors of the peloton and bike about tours they rent bikes they have a grand ole time but Christian is also the expert as far as everything goes when it comes to biking in Paris Christian is it safe to bike in Paris well we get asked that question a lot we say yes it's a great city for biking 100 miles of bike lanes it is a great city but um you'll see if we don't survive the trip then when that will answer the question right away got it that's fine we just we forgot to start right away but if you want to recreate the route we're gonna do today we will link to Christians map of this one it's all over [Applause] [Music] he's gonna be a double-decker so they're they're always adding more and doing construction but they're doing a massive bike laying on both sides of the river right now speaking of safety and riding along the river so well it will follow this mini tour here for a second [Music] look at the size of this bike lane holy cow oh man the cars will hate it just don't drive a car in Paris that's the answer [Music] all right stop one we've made it to Notre dumb the main takeaway is that they're building a huge huge bike lane they're doing one here where else are they doing one on the big Rue de Rivoli so like east and west you have all these ways to get around fantastic it's like a bus-sized lane for bikes so they're making a lot of efforts and making a lot of efforts that construction will hopefully be done in the next month or so I would guess they're getting really close but we'll see how long it takes them to do the whole length of the I have no idea how far it's gonna go taking a quick ride across the pond this fear that construction goes all the way to here and my assessment that it might only think a month might have been a little bit generous they think they've got a ways to go [Music] [Applause] yeah smooth it's a notable difference when you go from cobblestone to fresh asphalt Wow nice we're taking a little bit of a loop away from the river so we can get to the loop we ride through the loop and then we're gonna head over towards the Eiffel Tower along the river [Music] normally we would actually have entered through the cork at a the square Court here but they had the main entrance blocked off for construction and they might still be taking apart whatever they had in here for Fashion Week we'll see follow Christian he knows [Music] why is this one of your favorites it's kind of quiet and I think when most people come to the move they don't always wander back here so it's a little bit less crowded and usually doesn't have a giant catwalk on it [Music] not a bad view [Music] Oh one-handed couldn't do it the nice thing is that now that we're down by the river we can ride all the way to the Eiffel Tower from the Louvre along the river it's well paved generally smooth it's just a nice ride I love riding along the river [Music] there's a nightclub under here one hot tip for Americans if you're unaware you can't turn right on red when you're driving in France or anywhere in Europe really and that holds true for bikes too but Christian has a hack for you there you go um so this isn't the case at all traffic lights but you do have these signs on some of them so keep your eye out for these when you have these you can do what they say you can turn right sometimes on red so initially since when this light is red here we can actually go through because it says you got that straight arrow so we can just as be safe obviously yield that's the triangle to oncoming traffic but you can you can just go through if you're on a bike it's fantastic it's otherwise you just sit around waiting for traffic lights all the time and that sucks anyways we're almost at the Eiffel Tower which you can can you see it behind me oh it's hiding you can just barely see the antenna right here we're almost at the tower [Music] not too shabby I'll take it this is actually if you go back and you look at one of my videos on like I think it's like the five great photo spots of the Eiffel Tower there's one that's right near here hard to beat it was last time you were at the Eiffel Tower Christiane I was here two days ago oh really yeah I was actually just riding my bike crowd and rode over here it's so easy when you're on a bike you just pop around the city this is easy we've done how many probably like 10k at this point nearly I think we're like eight just generally flat and lovely [Music] dang prick space invader break we're heading from the Eiffel Tower to the Arc de Triomphe which is a little bit of a hill you have to not so bad Hills from here it's basically up to that and then from there to Moulin Rouge will be a little bit uphill and then it's downhill from there [Music] definitely earning my fancy dinner tonight oh yeah look at that anyways we're at the Arc de Triomphe which is easy enough Christian I'm question that I'm sure is bra priming a number of comments to be typed right now and we might as well cut that out why why aren't you wearing a helmet good question I usually don't wear a helmet just kind of cruising around the city I don't know why I spent a lot of time in Holland and in Holland knowing where this helmets as well anyway I don't wear one around around town if I'm doing some longer rides outside the city I definitely wear a helmet is it required it's not required under twelve so kids have to wear them yeah but adults it's optional we have them when we do our tours though if you want one when you go on tour and now if they rent you a bike you can get one too the other question that I have is at like a 12 year old doesn't have to or a 12 year old does have how about under 1212 so 11 and under yep yeah so if you're if you're 11 years old I'm sorry you have to wear it right after wear helmet [Music] this stretches between the Arc de Triomphe and then mark effectively it's not a lot to see but what is nice is that we've got this dedicated central path once you get a little bit further from town past Park month so we've got the central double lane highway for bikes all the way through to where we want to go and the hill is kind of even now I think we've done the heavy lifting and we're just gonna be downhill after this way more fun at night when it's all lit up and moving but does the trick you're here you can get your finish and then move along it this is Boulevard to kishi here go straight down the middle we'll be able to see sacre coeur from the bottom we're probably not going to go all the way to the top today and then we're gonna head down towards opera [Music] oh this is awful yeah so this is one of the worst parts of the whole city basically right up this street is sacre-coeur which you can see poking out right there that's the one benefit to using the selfie cam I can pointed things on camera we're not gonna go up there and we're trying to make good time today and show you how to get here but if you want to be there are side streets don't go up this street if you this is on there the metro stop and if you go straight up this street it's not going to work with a bike you can walk it just fine but no other bike so take one of the side streets wind your way up it's not so bad you can get up there and get a nice little photo and then Oh feel like we should at least get a photo at the base let's do it okay we're at least gonna go to the east [Music] Christian we made it we did we have one one little jaunt left we're gonna go straight back towards the Louvre we won't show you how to get the secret tunnel but if you rent a bike from these guys to be able to get it on the map take the secret tunnel that is secret super secret secrets that no Paris is best kept open secrets well I'll show you Maison Maison which is in the game if you wanted to stop and have a beer it's the perfect location Christian doesn't have time because he's a busy man he's got to go run that's successful to her company but I'll show you where you could get a beer on the river on your return to drop your bikes off back at the peloton and we'll go back to the Sun honestly what a perfect day to go for a bike ride this is amazing it's gorgeous out here that's all I have to say I wanted to get the Opera behind me while I was talking back to the bike reading I feel so good the traffic in Paris isn't that bad well that's not true they're making it worse all the time it's actually kind of congested if you're driving a car but reading a bike I haven't felt unsafe at any point here except for when I almost ran into a pole which was my own doing aside from that Oh NIC parry-jones good are you doing already Christian ready to show us the secret tunnel you know try and do this one-handed for my next trick I love this thing this is like my favorite part [Music] does Maison Maison this harass Terrace I don't know how about you'd call it the thing you know where chairs go outside usually filled up with chairs and umbrellas you can sit here right by pot enough have a beer it's the best spot to stop so if you want to use the route that we use today this is a great spot and we pull over grab a beer just park your bike's off to the side view you'll get a lock with them if you rent them from bike about sit down have a nice beer and then you've got an easy ride along the river all the way back to the peloton where you can turn your bikes back in and in the meantime you can just enjoy all of this I really wish that we had time to stop and have a beer because this is pretty amazing but we're gonna go ahead and keep going so yeah well we have one more thing we wanted to show you we gotta find one more sign we got to show you and then and then we'll go from there [Music] this is the last thing I wanted to show you guys this is I do not understand why are we going in this way yes a lot of people ask us what is that word so mean on those signs it actually means it's forbidden except so means except except bikes so on the street you'll have one way for cars like this with the yellow arrow then bikes can go both ways so it actually allows us to get around the city so much easier and that tip right there will save you a lot of pain if you want to go ahead and skip through traffic Jim mrs. Paul that was great I haven't ridden around the city like that in a long time it was really fun to bounce around spend some time with Christian obviously what was the final kilometer count so Christian is gonna send me a link to the route you can see how long was I guess 18 kilometers and we started well and then what do we ended up doing so 19.7 but we had the tunnel so I say it's even 20 yeah that sounds good to me we kind of we did kind of cheat a little bit there which you can to get out of here bus anyways thanks for taking me around man if you mentioned a Christian or Paul or whoever is working at the peloton when you come to rent a bike you saw this video yes so five euros off for rental well yeah just say that you saw Jay and I riding around the city and we'll make that happen let's get a good deal out of it I've definitely heard my calories for this fancy dinner tonight so I gotta go I gotta go shower now and then I'll be ready to ingest as many dairy products as possible alright showered shaved ready to go well you know sort of shaped not entirely shave other really quick disclaimer as I head over to what is hopefully gonna be the most delicious cheese experience in my life if nothing else I really have no idea what to expect from this dinner it's apparently like it's a private dinner with ten chefs from 10 different countries and a loft on the canal it's about all I know we'll find out here surely but the other thing I wanted to say is that we did bend the rules a couple of times to get to a couple of spots along the way but by and large our bike route today was not a percent aboveboard it did in a bunt down we went down one Street the wrong way on accident because we've got a little bit turned around but aside from that a couple other little things all good hey whoo let's head to the canal I have worked up quite the appetite I'm ready to eat something look at this handsome devil did you get did you enter behind me how did you get it I was waiting for a drink and it took too long huh yeah a good start from Olli [Music] basically there Ted chefs from around the world who are seeking adventure cheats and doing something you eat with it to sweeten guys from the most savory to the most sweet in that order we're just gonna bam-bam-bam through a but it's gonna be delicious [Music] see I've somehow wandered into chef Sally dodge out of here they're getting some sort of briefing anyways tonight was wonderful I'm probably gonna leave it here had a great time buy French cheese that's a little one of this events it's worth it it's delicious I want to eat more fresh cheese ten in a row was satisfying for me but for Oliver I was in row 10 I'd give it 10 out of 10 Jay [Applause]
