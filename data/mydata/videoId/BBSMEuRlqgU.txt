 are you allergic to love just an open question today's vlog in a 2012 good morning and welcome to day 12 of my 20 in 20 here in Paris today I'm in Paris is Twelve Colonies mom bugged her passageway that I've never taken before and I'm on my way to have coffee at a place I've never been before the twelfth is one of those spots that has a lot of really fun photo locations we're gonna go visit some of those today some really fun places to go visit and check out if you're here but not a lot of recommendations for food and for coffee I do have a bunch of recommendations for places to go for a drink some specialty cocktail spots so we're gonna try a new place for coffee today I'm going to meet Kate from dear Everest right now she's gonna join me and blend some of her photographic genius to the vlog today we will have some fun wandering around gonna go see a couple of cool spots like the kool-aid Matt Andrew come you among others and this this this passageway is actually really fun it's a lot of I really love this guy I think he's hilarious there's a lot of really good stuff down here but no space invaders what the heck anyway that's what we're doing oh yeah the 2020 I didn't explain what a 2020 was the 20 and 20 is basically Paris has 20 Ronnie's months and I'm spending a day in each making a video in each to just give you an idea a feel for what's in each but the spirit of the around these months is or are and yeah today's day twelve in the twelfth Romney's mom let's get coffee [Music] founder it was filming we have different priorities Kate and I saw this building want to take a photo we're doing that really quick then we're gonna go to Rupert um yeah copy there was nice we had a nice chat good spot oh now it's sunny and not the whole building I just not the top floor the 12th is not particularly big there's actually it's not the smallest Ronnie's not by any stretch but very big there's a spot that I'm going to go to for lunch under the cool a bets if you're not sure at the cool about this I'll explain that here in a minute you can also go see it in the spring Instagram video that I made with Ellen am that'll be a fun little walk you can see it down here the arch down at the end of this street is the creative answers part of it and who come he is just on the other side so she's never been to root mu before so we're gonna go check that out together got to go see that and then and then when we part ways I'll go to the cool a bounce and show you that on my own basically the 12th starts at the bestie roundabout and makes its way all the way to the eastern border of the city and spreads out because one of the fun things lesser known facts about Paris is that Paris has claimed two parks that's outside the periphery of its boundaries stealing territory as best I can so if you go into blood a balloon which is on the outside of the 16th if you go to the parks in Vincennes just on outside the 12th you're still technically in Paris even though kind of really not in Paris anymore [Music] hey mr. Krim yo this is your first time here you've never been here before yeah how long did you lived here three years that's impressive you behave I've seen it on Instagram like eight thousand ten knots think that's that's basically where this week actually exists [Music] and that was her first experience with the glorious Uruk commute it is one of those places that I think I shared this I shared about this on the video we made about taking photos there but it doesn't gender a lot of weird moments and there is club hem you on Instagram which is hilarious and just shows people taking kind of awkward photos or doing things maybe they shouldn't be doing on that poor Street where people do live so do respect it but of course if you don't follow deer everest kate on instagram you should go do that she's got a really nice style and she's also a grad student here getting her PhD so she's got to go do student e things and i'm gonna go check out guard lyon really quickly and then grab lunch because I'm really hungry guard Liang while not necessarily in and of itself a grand a tourist destination is a beautiful train station that does have a restaurant in it that is in my guide that is kind of a famous date spot so if you're looking to take someone on a date and you happen to be in this area Carter Liang not necessarily about options again I wouldn't necessarily come here just to hang out but it is fun to go into a translation every once in a while if for no other reason to imagine all the places that you could be going in which for me coincidentally I do need to make a trip to Lyon soon will I make it from here only time will tell but it's humbler oh wow they finished construction this humbler is that spot that i was talking about that is like the famous date spot lovely restaurant inside watch the world pass you by that's just that's in my god it's a tip [Music] if you didn't know you could eat under the Cunha Vance let's I'm gonna do right now and then we can go for a stroll above it well above above the restaurant on the kadai PLT you'll see I'm really hungry no chicken fingers but this will do and I am so ready for it lunch was tasty look at these there's some really fun shops underneath the crew daebak's one of the things a lot of people don't realize coude vast basically is it's an old train line that they converted it into a park it's the train line that inspired the High Line in New York and underneath it and a lot of these arches are some galleries shops really cool stuff not just a restaurant Shmi and see books and boxes and who even knows what's in all this stuff so I'm gonna go up and show you what the coup de vamp looks like makes for a very nice stroll a little bit crowded on weekends but otherwise really really chill don't just go above the cool a bounce go below it as well thanks for it it may make for a nice day it makes for a nice day a nice stroll you can go up on the very far end and then there are a couple of stairwells like this one that you can walk up as well you know which makes it nice if you don't want to walk the whole length of it you don't have to you can always bail in the middle [Music] as you can see it's I was about to is just about to say it's actually kind of quieter up here he used to heard of the traffic it's true but it is chill ambulances notwithstanding great spot to come sit pick a bench have your lunch read a book come up and read books one of the things I've been wanting to do more of lately to is read books I've actually been watching I watched a fantastic documentary yesterday I've made by Max Joseph if you know him through Casey and ISTEP probably he's a friend of Casey's but in a fantastic documentary about bookstores reading books reading more books and I've actually picked up a few books recently and it got me excited to keep reading so and Kate gave me a new book to read so I've got lots of books on the docket for the reading but this is a wonderful spot to come grab a coffee I was hit it harder to grab a coffee and walk over here obviously because this neighborhoods a little bit more devoid of the coffee but hop on up here grab a bench sit read watch the clouds go by enjoy some greenery and you know get out of the hustle and bustle for a minute it's fantastic you could be elevated above it that's gonna do it for me for the twelve today hope you enjoyed getting a little bit of a flavour here's one of those stairways down hope you enjoy getting a little bit of flavor of the 12th today my twenty and twenty day twelve tomorrow is gonna be the thirteenth obviously and I will see you bright and early tomorrow morning for that and a lot of discovery because I don't really know the thirteenth as well I'm looking forward to exploring it and we'll have Bhushan with us to show us a little bit more the 13th because he knows it better than I do and it'll be fun just to wander together I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for that [Music] bonus the twelfth is supposedly home to the best baguette in Paris they won the award this year the annual the 25th annual award doesn't look like they're owning it but Cheryl sent me a note to that
