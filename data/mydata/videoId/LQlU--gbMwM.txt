 bourgeois aromas a Bloggie day 901 [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] good morning it's Thursday which every day since I've been back is felt kind of like the weekend has just gotten over I don't know what's going on I'm really living in the time vortex right now today I have multiple meetings that I got to get to want to record a chapter or two in my audio book it's kind of on to get out and move around the city a little bit news coming on so far fine on the right track look like two days in and it's all good so far anyways really go meet my buddy Fox that good news coffee just opened up a few months ago it's been closed over the holidays but he's opening up tomorrow so we can go see him before he hoping this chat them for a minute and then we'll see what happens from there [Music] [Music] change your plans we're gonna meet a real coffee shop instead it's another coffee shop that's not far from his and there a special machine is on so I might have coffee too what let's be honest [Music] found him [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] third cup of coffee I'm going to be jittering back this great chat with Fox man's got some good ideas okay I got to go across town now grab a little bit of food along the way and then one more coffee shop and hopefully I shouldn't have any more coffee that that I didn't even I couldn't even finish that coffee he just made for me was delicious didn't want to finish it I would have been bouncing off the walls here we go [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Shaymin rice not a bad way to keep it like to lead now whatever they wanted to eat but you know that's just the way it's gonna be for a while now to try and avoid getting another coffee I think I might get another coffee [Music] of course one of the challenges that I have for myself this year is to use this camera more to learn how to use it better just hang out with Emily it's good to hang out at Malik thanks for having coffee with me she's a professional videographer and hanging out with like boo Sean like there's just a real push to get technically stronger to be a better photographer to take better advantage of the equipment that I have and to remember that Paris is the city that I should be out shooting all the time when we were in India it was easy because everything was fresh it's like oh my gosh this is so colorful so bright so much happening like was so much fun to shoot and I've been taking Paris for granted lately which is a terrible sin and so I want to make sure that I'm not taking Paris for granted and then I'm filming it well and I'm out and I'm enjoying it and loving living here because it's such a privilege to be here and I'm so lucky to be here and I love living here and that's one way that I can remind myself of that because sometimes it's easy to get wrapped up in life and forget it for a second so I'm gonna work on that and get out and try to shoot more and have fun doing it and in the meantime it's cold and hungry and have a little bit more work to do and I think it's time to go home to get all that dough [Music] and in a surprising turn of events I'm gonna take the evening off well I mean it's tough to edit my blog so that I never really get to take an evening off but I've really enjoyed spider-man into the spider-verse like a lot and I think I'm actually gonna go watch it again one of these is have a Cinna pass so I have like you know the unlimited movies subscription which is great but I haven't taken advantage of it and I've been seeing so many rave reviews of bumblebee which is shocking because the transformer movies have been just by and large terrible that I was like you know what forget it I'm just gonna drop off my stuff go watch a movie because why not sounds great I need to do a better job of resting over the next few days anyways I've been talking about it a lot Alex if you remember him from the pen of Chocolat video it was texting me to harass me about not resting no matter how much I say I'm going to so we're gonna figure it out don't worry but for tonight I think I'm gonna go watch that and we'll call it quits for today I hope that your 2019 is off to a rocky and good start and that you're feeling good about it excited about it I know I'm getting more and more excited about mine and I'll be able to share more with you about the specifics soon I'm looking forward to it and I will see you bright and early tomorrow morning for maybe some specifics but at least another day in Paris [Music]
