 I may not be a mathematician but today we blog in a 1018 good morning and welcome to day 18 of my 20 and 20 and bouncing around the 18th arrondissement here in Paris and if you recognize plastically she behind me it's because this is where I ended yesterday roughly where I stopped the reason I decided to come back here was not just for continuities sake but also because there's a space invader up here that I could not get I'm gonna try it one more time and then I'm gonna head to one of my favorite croissants in the entire city because I feel like you might enjoy being introduced to that it is of course in my video on the best croissants in the city as well as in my guide ah there's that space invader just gotta turn around I gotta try and flash this I'll be right back that actually work first right okay I got to figure out the fastest route to gone clown chef EA which is one of my favorite croissants in the whole city very good let's start there and then I think go straight up to Montmartre before the crowds get there one of the things that I didn't realize I've got known about this cemetery but it's also called the cemetery Montmartre there are two cemeteries in the 18th that seemed notable at least one of them is the cemetery Montmartre this one's down at the bottom of the hill I don't know if that's correct so I'm gonna try and find a plaque to verify that but I'm going a long way around to get to the croissant which is I think noble in my intentions but not necessarily what my stomach appreciates the most [Music] I'm having serious issues with my camera automatically stopping recording this morning so there's any dramatic drops in the monologues in particular sorry I'll try to fill you in as I go [Music] so good I think these guys are expanding because I saw that they moved into guard early on one of the train stations that's good news for everybody because they're really really good ok I'm heading up the hill we're gonna go straight to Montmartre I think the little village portion of it because the touristy stuff gets pretty swamped pretty quickly in the day no they want to be bouncing around in there when there's tons of people so I see that sakta car hopefully by then see lawn will be open go grab coffee and then we'll go under and explore some of the areas of Montmartre that maybe you've never seen before like this the back half of the hill is one of those parts that a lot of people have never gone and visited and I highly recommend you get to the back half of the hill because it's quieter nicer and really one of my favorite parts of the city [Music] [Applause] [Music] another spot that's in my guide that half the fun is figuring out how to get in his hotel particularly a which is not far from where I am right now going up the hill hot tip it's down that little private road so I think it's basically the mansion of a former a fashion designer can't remember I used to know the history that's turned into you feels like a private club slash bar kind of tricky to get into it but then the environments a lot of fun it's kind of ridiculous there chickens wandering around all over the place any of them we're getting close to the top of the hill already this was a lot easier than I expected I love this wheel [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the artists square they're really upping their table game I don't know what the schedule is like when they have tables out when they don't they're not always out though sometimes this place is just full of artists sometimes it's shared between artists and restaurants today it looks like it'll be artists and restaurants some really nice art up here you can get your face drawn not like face paint but like you can sit down at somebody else catch you caricature you paint you pretty cool and then there's a bunch of original art it there's a lot of art around the city I'm not gonna say you should buy art from here specifically because you see people on the river all over the place but personally I think some of the best souvenirs are souvenirs that you pick up from local artists people that are actually creating art and the people that are in this square are actually our actual artists they're not just sitting on the river like pretending to paint a print and then selling you other prints that art up here is legit it's great and there's some space invaders around here let's go check out sacre coeur the famous Church on top of the hill the Basilica and then copy time [Music] [Applause] [Music] but of course before we go to the front of the church I got Evie would work tip which is also another intro character location so if you didn't recognize that as being the location for the intro character of friday's america suit monday's was shot back behind the church in this fantastic little park that most people ignore or never even come around to see you'll see that there's a huge drop-off in the number of people that actually come around behind the church but the park my said bluestone blonde shea is a wonderful little park that is highly worth a visit and i'm just gonna pop in and show you we're all quack [Music] I love this park alright we'll go to the front of the church which I can't film inside the church not allowed to film inside sacre-coeur at least they asked you not to you so we'll see the front of it the view and then come on I hate this watch and then it's goofy time and don't forget as you walk away from the church just kind of come down this gentle slope and you're gonna discover a park here that you might have seen all over in I live stream from this Park has a nice little view of the Eiffel Tower it's a great spot to sit and again not a lot of tourists come over here which is one of the best parts of course today is extra hazy so Eiffel Tower shots might be a little bit difficult I haven't checked the air pollution report for today but I'm guessing it ain't good okay from here I'm gonna bounce my way down quite literally to see it all see it all do you remember in my guide also in the game if you want to grab some stickers fantastic coffee and I'm actually most excited about their carrot cake I just got to figure out the best way to get down the hill with the wheel I might actually cheat and take the pie just so I can get a fun shot and also I want to ride all the way down the hill on the cobblestones right now [Music] [Applause] this is only the second time I've ever taking this thing and while it feels kind of silly because I'm fine taking the stairs it's kind of nice I mean it's a lot of stairs [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh wait I mean I know closures the plague of closures on the 20 and 20 I tell you what an exceptional wait from that they stay closed from the 25th come on I hate this watch man I knew I should have texted them in advance but I was looking forward to surprising them I want carrot cake that's okay I have a backup thankfully unlike the 1716 14th and 13 I have more than just one coffee shop here I got plenty and one of my favorites is just another block away we'll go visit French Lauria and get some coffee from her Stowe carrot cake dang it [Music] well while we're at Abbess I might as well show you the love wall just in case you were curious where this was come out the abbess metro stop yeah and see no or just down the street but right behind it there's a little park and that has the loved wall classic photo stop but in the meantime I want a coffee stop so that's I'm gonna do like I said all you do is step out literally step out of the bus right here and then walk straight down the first street you see who you've on the deck and you're set also fun random fact about French deck I don't know if you've only attacked just made lots of noises or not but tack is kind of the noise you make when you're making things like duck Duck Duck it's my little French tip for there like when you're putting things in order you'd be like tak tak tak and there it's done bingo bango Bungo i guess it's kind of the equivalent I need coffee wait what there what wait is today oh today's Tuesday that's right they're closed on Mondays and two Mondays and Tuesdays now here I thought I was gonna be all clever and quick and well-organized and I am so thing is I was gonna do the front half of kind of got in the field for the front half of Moammar we've seen the top very touristy we're wandering through the southern side of the hill which is also pretty touristy but more local again I'm gonna wander back through the central part wood right directly in front of sacre-coeur which you can see tons of videos that I've done about sacre coeur the view from there all that kind of stuff if you want to wander through my other offerings but in order to get coffee from a place that I want to there is one option that's closer by here but I don't really feel like going there I wanted to go to lomi which is a roaster but also teaches roasting courses they're just like about 10 minutes away by wheel which isn't too bad but it's definitely a little bit more yeah whatever we'll just do that and then we'll do the back half of the hill guess that's how we're dividing we're just dividing it forcibly today so we're gonna wander around to the northeastern corner of the 18th to grab some coffee we'll regroup and we'll do a little bit more wandering [Music] thank god they're open all right [Music] so delicious so happy to bring their copy in my system okay from here I want to get back on the hill but first let's fast forward to a huge Ofcom drew Jeff cone is where you'll find the mayor's office of the 18th there's also a church here also realize that the the name of the cemetery on the hill is different it's Emma tell them someone's song but this is a fantastic area if you get out of this metro stop and you walk you start walking up the hill you're gonna find a lot of really great stuff which I'm going to show you here in a second including one of my favorite tap houses in the city if you walk down a little ways you find some great restaurants as well which is where I'm gonna go have lunch so will you act as you'll shop from in no time flat but before we do that I want to find a route back up the hill and show you a couple there's there are a million things I could show you in the 18th its unending I actually have like a dream of moving here to like live on the hill and relax I don't remember badger but badger lived just up the hill here in one of the best parts of the city seriously I have a fantasy about moving into Montmarte but until then we're just gonna go up to the top I'll show you like one or two things maybe we'll go find the vineyard and then we'll pop back down the hill for lunch I also used to live just down the street over here I just passed my old apartment when I first moved to Paris like 6 or 7 years ago however long ago it was that I first moved to Paris I just lived down the street from here I was a lucky guy and I didn't even realize just how lucky I was actually that that living that having a housing situation kind of sucked but that's a story for another time let's go up the hill the Barbie long love that place I've done a bunch of meetups there it's fantastic now what are the problems you can rent if you have a wheel is stairs there are stairs everywhere here which are great if you're walking for riding okay like I go around forget it I'm gonna take I'm gonna take the stairs this one time because otherwise it's gonna take forever to go around but from here I'm reading [Music] [Applause] just in case you didn't realize there was a vineyard in Montmartre that's one of the fun facts apparently the wine out of this isn't that good I've never had it people do warn you away from it that's the reputation it has at least I don't know I've never had it I would love to try it but it's also something like 40 euros a bottle so odds are slightly against it I've already climbed the hill twice now with my wheels so I think instead of going any further up I'm gonna work my way back down it's getting close to lunchtime there's so much more that we could see and do and explore up here it's kind of hard to limit myself to any one thing I just passed a bunch of bakeries that are really good there's a lot of really good stuff on here oh you know what I'm gonna go see I'm gonna go see if the Lamacq called encore Metro sign has been repaired yet because that is my favorite in the entire city and was destroyed during the World Cup and I hope it's back I don't think it is though [Music] [Applause] [Music] well I learned something today because I always thought that was the Montmartre Cemetery but that's the cemetery the Sun bounce song had that backwards this whole time I love that little cemetery though it's really nice right underneath the church in the distance it's great okay just across the street from here and down these stairs to the mark : core it is a metro station with the coolest most iconic metro sign that was unfortunately destroyed thanks to world cup revelry and is it back will it be back nope it's still not there sucks maybe we may never get it back probably pretty low priority wish I understand it still I'll try to find him put a picture up word to for you so you can see it I wanted to come back so badly let's mosey on down the hill and try to find ourselves some lunch [Music] [Applause] [Music] yohoo so these guys are actually it might guide twice early so my master twice because they've got another location down in ra which is nice a really good for their customer service I've cared their being restaurant you know they even let me come and say warm up because it's really cold outside yeah so they're letting me just chill while we wait for the kitchen to open because we're the nice thing I really hungry I'm really ready for this burger [Music] [Applause] [Music] I was so good it's been a long time since I've been here like I don't think I've been here in a year almost a year and I just wanted to double-check that the customer service was still as good as I remember it it is it was super nice anyway I'm gonna leave it here I feel like there's so much more I could have touched on in the 18th so many more things because even barely scratch the surface I really want to come back and spend this but I just love this neighborhood I want to come back and spend as much time as possible here and I think I will again in the future but for now that's gonna be a wrap for the 18th day of my 20 and 20 I will see you bright another tomorrow morning for day 19 and the 19th Arnie's Mont and I hope it was only for that see tomorrow [Music] [Applause]
