 like they'd 1003 yeah here we got a move [Music] good morning and welcome to day three of my twenty and twenty so far so good however said hey I'm in the North Maryam in the third around a small debatable where you would want to draw your lines around the Marais but the downside to being in the Marais on Monday is pretty much everything is closed that's okay there's still a lot of really good food here really good coffee really good everything the third is possibly my favorite arrondissement for food it is my favorite run it's not for food I can't say probably about that is freaking amazing I love this around he's not including one of my favorite bakeries in the whole city it's just over here since I'm on a bakery binge I'm gonna get myself a tasty croissant [Music] good I know that their croissants and panitch ocular delicious I thought I'd try something else he's a very different shots on a palm if you don't know if that's not a problem is is kind of like an apple turnover they usually am really flaky this one's a lot more dense but it's like in like a biscuit you know cookie dough that's really good it's gonna be a morning with a sweets because it must meeting with buddy Anna who you might remember from Budapest that fringe for coffee I have to get a cookie at fringe as well I got to show you those cookies cuz they're phenomenal let's go back to frames I'm just gonna ride around and eat this name if we're going to fringe does I don't want to bring this in with me [Music] this invader is gonna be the death of me I can't get it Richard's wife was able to get it and then eventually she was able to get it for him but neither of us were able to get it I still can't give it I'm gonna stand here for the next two minutes and try to get it and then I'm gonna go I gotta get back to fringe I finished that delicious and strange chefs on a pom it was very very very good and after I have coffee I'll explain you what I mean by marae Mondays being everything's quiet I wanted to go to at least one Museum today every museum I wanted to go to today is closed welcome to marae but I'm only a few invaders away from 500 so I really want to get this one because I have pretty much all the others in this neighborhood I don't know I'm sure there's some that I haven't gotten in this neighborhood but I've gotten most of the ones in this neighborhood cuz I love this neighborhood not kidding I stood here for six minutes trying to give them that 6 ok I was exaggerating more like 4 minutes but still 4 minutes of constant flashing I still can't get that one is driving me crazy it's like the only one that I can't get around here it's I'm gonna go nuts ok going completely crazy aside coffee will help Coffee will definitely help bring this down a notch I'm gonna be Richard for lunch after that you know I'll just show you a couple of really cool places but all these places are a my guide obviously if you are just tuning in for the first time ever I wrote a guide to Paris it's a PDF download it to your phone has 240 plus recommendations lots of essays about where to go where to stay what to see what to do all based on you know my stuff I actually love in the city some of it being pretty standard touristy stuff some of it being hidden gems a lot of it being hidden gems actually it's gotten rave reviews so far I hope you enjoyed if you do grab it and in the meantime I'm gonna enjoy a cup of delicious coffee at Fringe which is also in the game another thing you want to play the game while you're here get some stickers earn some free stuff totally worth it [Music] Coffee was delicious as always I'm gonna get Anna her first Space Invader getting her set up there she bid she noticed them all on her own when she started so she's a natural should go really easy here gonna send her on her way to the Luxembourg Gardens and I'm gonna get around to showing you all those places that I said I wanted to go today but only gonna be able to see from the outside yeah I was gonna say is it perfect yeah well done so do I like see you open the app yeah it's a good place to start yeah no you could get it from here just you can zoom in that little bars to zoom okay go stop it there you go okay your first one yeah those cookies are addictive okay got her addicted to Space Invaders that's well we'll see let's see how that goes oh I could have walked her over here there a couple more that I could have gotten her oh well she'll find the mana room you can lead someone to space invaders but you can't ok there's there's no analogy there one of the places that is in my guide that I really wanted to go today that I can't go today is marche de Zampa whoosh which is just up here I'll show you the gate at least it's a fantastic market with lots of restaurants as well as fruits and vegetables whatever you want to get that is delightful and delicious and then we'll go through a park and then I'll show you a couple of museums from the outside that we won't be able to go in you'll get the idea pretty quickly as to you know this district amazing for food decent for museums and that's it I forgot about the cherry invader just outside the gate there right across the street from that a person scooped me a cookie which is my one of my favorite cookies in the city it's all they do is cookies literally just cookies both of my guide of course Marcia is on part Rouge you've seen in a number of my videos along the way really sad that we can't go inside and see it the downside to being constrained doing this every day is that I cannot plan for unique schedules for the locations but it doesn't mean we can't go to the park [Music] shkreli Tom this is the one Park in the neighborhood that I wanted to make sure to show you this fantastic spot to come have an impromptu picnic if you go to Marcia it is on Felucia find yourself something tasty to eat there bring it here sit on a bench enjoy the sunlight it's a simple park it's not the most impressive Park in the city but it is a nice park nonetheless [Music] like I said I have most of the Space Invaders that I have a lot of space and babies in this neighborhood so the solution to that problem would be to go off the beaten path for a minute and explore not a lot of parks or anything to go see here and you know basically just trying to make sure I earned my lunch so in the meantime I feel like I've been everywhere around here I haven't found anything new for a long time [Music] Pompey do the famous modern arts museum you can see from the third but it is not in the third it's right on the border just south of it so we're gonna dodge that for now head towards the Picasso Museum which I wish I could take you into along with a handful of others like the hunting museum which is ridiculous and I really wish I could take you in to F to go see that some other time and then lunch I asked Richard if he could choose anywhere that was both open today ideally obviously and in my guide where would he want to go he decided on tacos I fully endorsed this decision let's go get some tacos [Music] the Picasso Museum is one of those spots that I really wanted to show you today and I guess we get a little bit of a peek inside the courtyard here but they're closed on Mondays the other one is the Cana by they I've actually never been to it because it's been closed ever since I moved back which stinks it's a museum basically about Parisian history in the 16th and 17th centuries phenomenal based on the photos I've seen everything I've heard and sounds amazing this place also probably fantastic but no entrance today there's also oh there's an invader around here somewhere that I don't think I have so I'm gonna bounce around for that and then I'm gonna move on for the candelario experience even though there aren't a lot of parks or major monuments this is still a wonderful wonderful area just to walk around obviously to eat I'm obsessed with the food in this area but it's a fantastic neighborhood just to stroll through because there's so much beautiful and buried architecture lots of little parks that are kind of nice to just kind of pop into for a picnic and it's just generally you know cool also fairly famous for shopping and you know general positive vibes [Music] Goo's deep stoking me now yeah swoop it around behind you I'm ready for tacos [Music] lunch as expected was delicious but for Holy's there are always really really good they change the tacos up all the time if there's a pork option and you're a pork eater their pork tacos or whatever a variety are always delicious give it a try we're gonna Richard's going to show us one more quick drinking option if the speakeasy is not for you and then I think that might be a wrap on the day the third amazing for coffee food drinks revelry of all digestive types but not necessarily the biggest touristy spot so come here to eat and then it's really easy to bounce out of here to see some awesome stuff I did it's really good shopping great yeah the the independent design is up here are still going strong and don't forget the succulent store right across right across from fringe this is this will be my fav my sister's favorite store in the entire city I guarantee it look at this thing it's closed today too for renovations but there are lots of cactuses if you want to cactus and Gustav wants the wheel so the Mary Celeste opens at it looks like six o'clock not in my guide but if Richard recommends it it's gonna be good yeah this is a one of the funnest drinks spot scene in the third or even in Paris really this is the real go-to for me when I first came to Paris and the favorite we always go back to really good wine list really great staff really fun place to come and leave you if you want to come and meet people that you don't know and it's really friendly vibe you can always come here and talk to the staff I talk to the people around here because it's just a really fun place here leave every time I've left here I've left with a bounce in my step we all need a little more bounce in our step spin which my wheels about to go down because I'm using my left foot that's not good I'm gonna zip to the Metro from here I'll probably leave you here there's also across from the Mary Celeste since I've been talking about spacing bitters all day there is a ghost of Mario ghosts although it's kind of covered by scaffolding at the moment good luck with the scaffolding when you come to visit Paris anywho that's the third more or less so I couldn't show you any museums today that's okay we're gonna get to a museum here soon one of these days as we bounce around and I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for the 4th the the main chunk of the Marais we're gonna jump into that tomorrow and plenty more see tomorrow [Music]
