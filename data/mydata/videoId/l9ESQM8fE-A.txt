 that's vlogedy 975 you guys that spread about smoking in the morning you just ruin all your meals for an entire day it's wonderful good morning it's a beautiful Monday here in Paris and today as promised I'm gonna go do a little bit of a photo shoot now the ladies that I'm meeting right now amber and Janelle I've been in Paris for about a year and a half two years I think and like many people that get into tourism around here kind of started by just kind of stumbling into things that they loved about the city that nobody else really seems to know about when they got here and then developed a way of sharing that with the friends and family whenever they came to town they're both photographers and they do two things they do photo walks but they take you on a couple hour walk and in some locations at the center of the city which would be pretty hard to find on your own or maybe you just would miss when you're wandering around so they make a nice little photo tour out of that give you a little sense of hanging out with some friends while you're walking around taking photos and they get you some good shots for your Instagram the other thing that they do is photo shoots and I think that's what we're doing today I think they're gonna do a photo shoot and I get to be the model today mm-hmm and so with my vast experience and modeling we're going to have a good time and we'll see what it's like to my knowledge they end up meeting you wherever it is you want to have your photo taken and then kind of customize it to what you like to do but we'll know for sure once we've had our photos taken in the meantime they wanted me to meet them at Trocadero so I guess we're gonna start with some Eiffel Tower shots [Music] Thank You Jo [Music] this is her this is her going on a tent number two she's just screaming ahead [Music] yeah that's a good idea you're a future surfer sorry Emily she took the best first student award away from you that quickly so why you what are we doing today so what do we have to you we thought would take you to a couple of our favorite spots to shoot and another spot which we've been scoping out which we thought would be perfect for you perfect for me is good this is one that you would normally do if you can get away with it assuming we can get away with this they've asked me to take it a walk out on the on the wild side here and I do feel okay with Heights generally I'm gonna have my camera [Music] [Music] just a disclaimer if you're not here at the right time during the year there won't be blossoms but there'll be other flowers all the time the blossoms are just for me though you can't happen [Music] [Applause] [Music] there's a disclaimer on this location what is the disclaimer are you saying that I'm not even enough for this shot cuz are you trying to say it's so beautiful and you will look beautiful oh thank you I appreciate that was a good save good save okay [Music] [Applause] in and out how are my spins you don't have to go over the top until Lipinski already really morning she's to avoid crowds no Deb preset greets you taped her photo shoots are you kind of open did going wherever people want to get their photos we go wherever really so you can choose your locations and at each location we have a like Chiclets on our website we're all say like the length of time so how many we can do in an hour don't mean you can like pick all that you want to do and then we'll organize the route to make it the most [Music] it's a lot of fun of course it's always fun to be at the center of your own photo shoot I mean let's be honest just thought I'd write around a little bit there we're gonna shoot on the other side of the center of beer Hakeem here and then basically if you want this is just one of the little routes that they've created for me but if you wanted to go to anywhere specific yourself we're gonna go down there and shoot this sounds good so what could be kind of fun is actually a few throws [Applause] [Music] okay we're gonna do another pass here and I'll talk to the camera while we do it see you guys see what it looks like actually someone in the comments recently asked how I hold the camera when I'm talking to it like this so you're about to find out I guess in the photo you'll see it basically my lens is in 18 to 135 at 18 it gets wide enough that I can actually hold it and talk to it you know it doesn't look like it's too far away or too close hopefully [Music] [Music] all right that's a wrap on the Eiffel Tower right yeah now to the center of the city which is good because I actually have to go to the old Alliance to have a meeting at some point so you can green grab a beer and redundant who knows [Music] the joy of reading plus we survived the bus just not a fan of buses in general but yeah that was extra pack anyways we're on our way to Palais Royale but since we were on the bus the figured might as well stop here at Pont Alexandre clock and go from there also the selfie cameras microphones probably better for this especially with the cars too much to think about [Music] [Music] this said this is good for fans of midnight in Paris why is that I also gave them candies so they're having a hard time speaking without smacking just put it in your cheek against your teeth you may recognize this bridge and Midnight in Paris where they famously say that Paris is actually most beautiful in the rain today it's not raining but it's still beautiful is it the most beautiful in the rain do you think I think it's pretty in the rain but I think I like you better with clouds and Sun where candy at nighttime it's beautiful it lights up so we have three opinions there blue skies some clouds nighttime which could be cloudy or not ah that's sweet [Music] [Music] maybe the best place because there are so many options the main reason is there's not a bad angle like look everywhere you look there's something to look at it's beautiful it's really soft looking the lights usually really nice as well and you can change environments pretty quickly where you have a gate you have a door you have four columns so you have the garden the flowers in the fall it's super beautiful with all the trees and the line so yeah that's pretty nice and there's also a copy kit cine it's really amazing and so we're gonna have that super casual shot or you're just holding the coffee cup in your hold the takeaway anyways yeah are we gonna get coffee great oh those blossoms look amazing right yeah perfect okay what are we doing perfect time it's first are you good to do some photos for something coffee after I'm yeah I'm good to do whatever in whatever order look we want the coffee cup [Music] yeah it's really impressive I don't think you ever fully realizes how amazing it this she is are you like a professional ice skater what is this yeah sure you're not that was really really good all right back to the photo shoot now [Music] for those of you wondering where we are we're currently in the Palais Royale which is one of the most beautiful spots in the city to go for a photo or a coffee or a dog walk anyway we're gonna grab a prop in the form of coffee because they want me to have a coffee cup in my hand for a couple of shots and go from there I'm also not sure if that dog is freaking out because of my wheel or something else but find out you lost half of year battle that'll happen if you haven't purchased my guide to the city yet consume he's not in the guide yet but will be when I do an update how they worth it is on my map stir if you're a patron of mine that's how you can find them siliceous it's like a hidden secret I didn't know about it until like two months ago I think with Richard Richard is the one that introduced me to this spot so we'll get our prop caffeinate my favorite kind of problem right perhaps ago that's wrong I have been struggling with being relaxed on this shoot for sure so I need uptight that's right I had somebody had to tell me [Music] another great time these guys are a lot of fun we're having fun taking some photos around their ass and they're being very nice to me [Music] tell me you guys went they so this has been a lot of fun I've had a good time I don't mind being the center of attention but for people that are there coming so you were saying one of the benefits is that there are two of you there seems to be that one of you can be actively shooting and the other one can be doing the direction make sure everything looks good are there other reasons why that really works out it's like one tiny thing can actually make the whole shoot off like no it's like you didn't notice that you're doing it or whatever and so one person is fully focused on like helping me well comfortable kind of getting that emotion out well the other person is working the technical things making sure the frame is perfect you know all this but to work really amazing photos and so that's why the two of us help to like maybe crack some jokes so try and just like like yeah that you can get those those really special memories so if they want to come to all the same locations we just did they they they could but you go other places too any other photo walk as well right yeah so we have a long list of locations that we do already go to but we also can go anywhere really because all about shoots of private if you want a particular location as long as you let us know in advance then we can go Scout it out and check if yeah and it's if you give us a little more information about who you are and what you're doing and kind of like the style you like it's more casual and cozy or it's more formal then we can kind of match places based on that we also do a photo walk like you said you so people who maybe you want to just walk around Paris a little bit you don't want necessarily a photo shoot but you just want a few memories then that's the idea you get ten photos and memory to take home is the perfect seven souveneir I get and are you guys gonna be in the game yes we can't wait okay I was gonna say they're also in the game so you can get a franc from them as well for going on tour yeah and I always had a really good time with these guys I'll be linking to them below if you want a book with them any time you shouldn't obviously check them out on Instagram as well if you're curious about seeing that and you also see photos and you pop up there eventually they do normally take about a week cuz it's a lot of editing that goes into putting these photos together making them look really good but they can't expedite them to be quick so maybe they'll expedite one or two so I can actually put them on the screen and you can see a couple of the photos that we've taken today and otherwise jump on there's a lot of fun I really had a good time so yeah thanks guys yeah [Music] those ladies are a lot of fun that was really good I like it it's not one time since I've been on a little bit of a photo shoot had a great time with them you want to sign up for a photo shoot with them they'll give you 10 euros off if you use the code that I'll put below I believe it's j-10 but make sure to actually double check below because we might have to change it at some point I will link to them sign up for a photo shoot or a photo walk will go on one of their photo walks next time where instead of them taking photos of you all the time they just take you for a couple hours on a nice walk through some very photogenic locations just help you get those Instagram photos all loaded up and yeah they've got both you'll see them both on the website sign up for one Center for both you'll be able to get a franc for each one you go on and they do have one unique sticker right now and I'm gonna hook them up with a second one here soon should be pretty good anyways I had a great time I'm gonna pop on over to I've one more meeting to get to today so I'm gonna go do that right now and then I should be done for the day I hope I've got a phone call with my sister this evening to talk about strategic she's got some big stuff going on in her life looking forward to chatting with her cuz I love talking to my sister I just also wanted to film long enough to go through this colony like this because I mean it's too much fun not to I love this wheel this it's just too much fun to leave behind okay somebody gave me coffee somebody brought coffee from Nebraska I saw the name I can't names on the screen because I was gonna say thank you but then it just saw a whole lot of people and said goodbye to a lot of people all at once and now my memory is shot - thank you for the coffee love that place always good to run into people anywho I am on my way home I got a phone call my sister I got ahead I got to work so I'm just gonna leave you here today I will see you bright and early tomorrow morning for yet more madness here in Paris Christian and I are gonna go do a little bit of a bike tour
