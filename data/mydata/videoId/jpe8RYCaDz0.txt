 on this most awesomest day of vug a 560 I just want you to remember good morning it's Saturday I made myself get up because I'm gonna go try and get some work done Cheryl's having birthday around 2:00 today so having lunch with her and some of the others and then yeah I'm just gonna try and get a bunch of work done we shall see what happens but the river is flooding right now to the point that like it's popping up in all the news there's warnings on Google other people have been receiving texts warning them of the flooding apparently nobody's worried about me dying in the flooding so I'm getting no texts but I figured we go check out the flooding River right off the bat and then I'm gonna head to the peloton grab some coffee try to get some work done and then go grab lunch that's the whole party one of the things I've been doing a terrible job of lately is asking you near the beginning of the video to subscribe so if you haven't subscribed yet please do subscribe I'd really appreciate that little red button click and of course if you like the video like it and leave a comment as we go now let's go check out the river [Music] the whole tip of the island is underwater [Music] pretty nuts I think I've seen it I've seen it high before but I don't think I've ever seen it this high these reports were a little bit more dramatic and I actually kind of expected it to be even higher but I definitely was impressed when I saw it like pretty crazy [Music] insane amount of water like I don't know if you recognize but all that area down there along the wall here that I'm walking next to you is where we ride our bikes usually a fairly large road that is currently completely submerged along with the beaches of Paris and a number of outdoor exercise facilities and all kinds of stuff just completely buried there was a toilet I couldn't get it because I couldn't zoom enough on my phone there was one of the automated toilets that was open like the doors were kind of stuck mostly open I mean I'm sure all the toilets down there I ruined the don'ts definitely ruined either that or it's the source of all of us flood water it's pretty big week [Music] wait what why did it change my backbone [Music] I think I've decided I'm like 90% sure I'm going to kick-start couriers I think I'm gonna do it the internet wasn't working for me so I started writing out the project stuff I just think it's a really good idea to like make sure that I'm on the same page as my students kind of walk through see where the struggles are for me as well with what I'm telling them to do but it's actually it's interesting because it's a challenge even though I'm teaching people how to do it like actually create a Kickstarter campaign even if you know what you're doing I mean it's a lot of work but my handout that I've been working on on the structure and how to put it together I've found to actually be fairly useful already which obviously I know what's going on within it so I'm not exactly the most unbiased person on that but that's good so I'm working on it I'll give you guys the final yes or no but I'm gonna be I'm gonna be I'm feeling pretty excited about it you're gonna do it anyways it's time for Cheryl's birthday lunch which was going to happen at a bagel place but the bagel place is closed she's suffering a little bit from my curse of going to closed places so they found something else I'm gonna walk there now through this delicious market and wish that I could get a crepe I am hungry and ready for lunch I hope she found a place that smells at least half that good salad I think egg ham and cheese [Music] [Applause] I assure you it's video [Music] [Applause] ladies know whatever you do I've seen that one a dozen times but I've never scanned it apparently that happy birthday again again and so many birthdays you're gonna be like 50 in like a week at this rate keep having birthdays well got a little bit more done basically because the internet was not working for me today for whatever reason I just wrote as much of the campaign text as I could for this Kickstarter that apparently I'm now doing definitely pretty good about it we have to go back through it's interesting you might have said this earlier but it's really interesting to go back through and work on something with tools that I created and feel like yeah okay this makes a lot of sense it's almost not that it's too easy but it's like almost too easy this should be harder I'm sure the refinement process and all of the self-doubt and recrimination will make up the difference for other quickly a plan right now is to go home go for a run my phone is about to die I'm also might call my dad while he's on the road headed to pick up my mom he's up at a lake in North Central Washington right now so are you gonna pick her up there and then we'll see what happens from there it's been a really scattered day we can check in on the flooding of the Sun again later but apparently it's as high as it's gonna get don't think it's gonna get any higher and it's still not as high as it got two years ago according to Paul andreas husband so that's kind of sad I mean that's good I don't know it'll be good when it goes back down I got nothing else outside a cookie at the peloton it was pretty tasty I got nothing I got I got back and I tried calling my dad and he didn't answer I just put my head down then I put my head down and fell asleep for like 15 minutes so I just like much needed enough I definitely needed to pick me up anywho now let's go for a run I'm tired I don't know why I'm crashing so hard this afternoon but a run a run will help run dinner edit and we'll see if we have time for anything else like a life probably not it was about a nine minute pace for miles nothing special but I and Cheryl informed me that a lot of those numbers don't mean anything so you know it was it was not a great run it was an okay run I didn't have a good energy I'm glad I went for it I needed it but I'm just kind of I can't shake this funk last few days it's up and down a little bit but I'm just feeling like this would probably sound funny or weird I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels this play sometimes but just feel like the world's biggest loser the last couple of days and it's not my favorite way to feel say the least but that said yeah Rose another day it'll be great and we're actually do yoga natasha teaches a class every other week and I'm gonna go take Natasha's class yoga class which should be fun and then afterwards I'm drea Cheryl and I are finally gonna film that video on how to find an apartment in Paris so for those of you that have been dying for that to come out we're going to endrias place go see Andrea's new place and film that so anyways I've got to go get some tortilla chips and try and figure out this whole guac situation I wasn't gonna eat the guac in Pico right away but the guac itself is probably not gonna last more than another day or so I don't think I don't know how much longer to last but we're gonna make some ravioli dancey ravioli have some walk probably some Pico yeah and maybe call that a day we we will see [Music]
