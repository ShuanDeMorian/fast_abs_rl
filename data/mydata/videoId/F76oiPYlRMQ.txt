 I don't think I've ever seen such a beautiful face watching such a terrible vlog but today is vlogger day 657 it's actually fairly late it's like 10:00 a.m. a little bit later I want to go for a run before I go meet Jeff in a gang for lunch I was up I believe is one might expect it I need to get over myself so let's I haven't been for a run in a really long time I need to get back on that horse so let's go for a run we'll meet them for lunch it's gonna be a crazy day it's gonna be a busy day I also need to upgrade my shoes and I know that I have some shoes downstairs in my garage that are new thinks that aren't stands I'll get those it's gonna be a day lots of little things to try and get done in the midst of playing host and tour guides so yeah they believe they're good on their own this morning we've got some kind of chuckle off their set but I want to go join them as soon as I can so let's go for a run [Music] I look for a really really quick run cuz days getting off to a late start and I don't want to make them wait for me forever so let's go one more thing before we leave them the innocence brought me a serious I got the reason it so the last couple of days have noticed my legs especially since Scotland have been getting kind of tired because I don't think that the shoes that I have are any good anymore really and then you just kind of kill me over time these guys we're kind of they got sick of seeing my really ratty dread bands so they brought me individually without Tim sure awesome hi this is only thing that's not Iike a Disney PDP's they're pretty sweet they're gonna be good these are gonna be great they're gonna replace my premix today like immediately brand new no more slippery death traps these on Sophie's Mike's with me to find out there's a bunch of stuff in here I'd read the card those other thing they did thank you guys so much there are one Nita's in here Juanita's chips the best tortilla chips possibly ever which you can't get here in two different shoe boxes whoa it's cool everything central thank you guys oh and some khaki oh my gosh and some collared shirts I really hope these pick I don't know what my waist is anymore and they did find the managed to find a 33 waist maybe I'm in 33 way sir we'll find out thank you so much you guys this is so nice of you this is this is the matically appropriate I wish I would have opened this before going for my run thank you guys so much I need to shower and get out of here I'll dig into this little bit more later but thank you so very very much meantime jenny is a shower I'm having a little bit of an issue because it turns out that getting from Belfast to Galway is not easy I mentioned last night that the friends I'm gonna go join I thought we're gonna be in Belfast there actually be in Galway which is like five hours away from Belfast and there's no direct route to get there you have to go south to Dublin and then over and the buses take forever and I can't figure out how to book one of the buses because the websites were all breaking so I just rented a car again attempt number two of renting a car you will see how this goes I'm not gonna forget my driver's license this time I cannot the other problem is I kind of want to wear my baseball hat but it's still kind of beanie season but it's still kind of a little bit too warm for the beanie but I need something to cover my head because it's sunny outside and I think it goes sunburned yesterday that's my other story you know but figure it out as we go I also figured out that yeah definitely like a 32 waist at the most definitely not 33 33 years I don't know how my waist got so small it's ridiculous anywho let's get out of here [Music] [Applause] [Music] minister walk right past you somehow I walked all the way down the other way [Music] he's not as good we'll grab a coffee and then these guys want to go see notes you're dumb so that is what is next on the docket assuming we don't get hit by any cars along the way Judy's time and then tonight what I forgot to mention was actually going to Johnny's for his experience tonight which should be si donated by cars to be really good I've been making video for him about that as well so combinations all over the place [Music] I love this church still probably my favorite Church in the city I think this is number one sec recur is easily number two but it's really hard to beat this one just the lead photographer left frozen Manny back it's not Chapelle so they could go see the stained glass and these guys just wanted to go sit down somewhere I'm gonna go drop off the disposable camera number four to get developed Elaine is the one that wanted the whole thing it's hers and when she told me what she wanted me to do with it was actually to take it get it developed and then make the make the prints available as digital downloads but only in exchange for donations to my travel fund which is very generous of her so thank you all and appreciate that I just need to go get them developed first she even actually sent me cash to pay for them to get developed it's crazy too much you're too nice so I'm gonna go get that done and then we'll see what comes with them and I'll make hi the full resolution versions available for download for like she wanted me to do a minimum of five dollar donation I just got to figure out how to make that happen [Music] this is the first building to blow your mind is are you're saying I mean no Jadhav of course is cool this is another topic Church different buildings for different folks yeah that's fair it's one of the most underrated buildings in the city though by far these guys are great I really do like this store okay I'm gonna head to the old Alliance see if Jeff's even made it that far he's in super photography mode which is great I'm actually really enjoying it it's fun to see them enjoying the city I tend to take the city very much for granted now I love it I love you though so I go on about my business most of the time it's really really fun to have friends come visit and appreciate all the things that sometimes I forget to appreciate or least take the time to enjoy and and these guys are kind of chill moving through the city slowly just enjoying themselves in such a good way that I don't know very nice to see the city through their eyes so we're gonna grab a beer here I think we'll take some drinks down to the river sit down by the river Kirk is still there we'll drain her rented to her just a minute ago I don't know if I actually capture that on film or not and then we've got a shot Nev this evening and then the Eiffel Tower sparkling at night and that is a very full [Music] had a couple of beers in there Jeff and crew left to go take a quick break in the hotel it's understandable they're a little bit tired I got a little bit of work done left feel the lines obviously and now moment where DeSean needs a little early come a little bit in there as he cooks and then I'll go film during the experience as well make a video for him make a video for me oh yeah it's a lot of videos today I'd film way too much I don't know what I've even got something [Music] I'm so full right now my god [Music]
