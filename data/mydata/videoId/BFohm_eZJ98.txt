 why is 730 I will try this again it's the end of the day now we're gonna go back in time briefly just to say warning it's not morning now good morning it's Monday my equipment is betraying me I was gonna talk to you today a little bit about Who I am and what the heck is going on because my channel is grown significantly recently and I haven't done a very good job of telling to go what the heck is going on when I had to explain to two people yesterday who I am how I got here in Paris and what the heck is going on so yeah let's do that back to this morning where I think everything worked out ok basically when people ask me why I'm in France the short answer is because I want to be and it's not actually that I want to be in France per se it's actually I want to be in Paris I love Paris I love life in the city I just love being here that architecture the people the food the lifestyle in general still at home here so I lived here before five years ago I've loaded in France three times in total I've lived in something like seven countries depending on how you count lived and out of all of them I just really enjoy living here the most maybe that'll change someday maybe I'll move on I don't know but for now I'm happy to be here [Music] the summed up version of how I ended up here then is basically that I was volunteering on a hospital ship in West Africa for about three years and I needed to get a job that actually paid so I took a consulting gig I was bouncing around the country that guy was underplayed every three and a half days so I've been on I've flown a lot in my short time bounced around the United States doing that for a couple of years and about halfway through that started a tech company with some friends in California developing a not a safety band well it's the easiest way of saying it a little bracelet kids wearable that would let you know if you're small kids got too far away from you when you were out and about you can go back and check out all this stuff or in the vlog because I thought well you know what I'm gonna start vlogging when I hit my 2,000 foot of the day it also been posting a photo every day for years so I was like when I hit my 2,000 foot of the day I'll start vlogging every day as well getting a personal chorus here behind us add some gravity to what I'm saying so so I poured everything I could into that I had a couple other projects ahead like some hopeful book deals and I figured somebody's gonna go well I should be vlogging while I'm doing this because I want to catch the good stuff as it happens and then it all went badly whole Dave work where were we basically when everything fell apart I was traveling at the time I was actually in the Caribbean as I realized the wheels are kind of coming off like the book deal wasn't gonna happen and then I can Paris on a lark and realized here that the tech stuff was also not gonna happen so in the midst of those two things falling apart not feeling great about the world my friends here actually convinced me to come back they were like listen we'll get you work you should come back that's not easy to do you ever wanted to move to France is not easy it's not that I didn't want to live here I've always wanted to live here it was that bonus you actually make that happen [Music] I don't know how to make it work there was a Issa that was available that everybody knew about it was like the holy grail of visas it was the company tones to tell if you're good go for that there's a whole long story behind that as well I didn't end up getting it they ended up passing me off to a different office and hooking me up with a visa they didn't even tell me what the name of it was how long it was good for if I'd be able to work nothing I didn't know anything about this visa but they gave it to me and I only had like 11 days left of status on the airline that I've been traveling with for those years that I was on and off again flying all the time and I was like I gotta go why I saw this cuz otherwise my bags won't be free so I moved over here this is all in the vlog by the way you can go back and watch pretty much all of this stuff happen in real time pack my bags moved over here I had a place to live thankfully that's the only way I could afford to come here is that a free place to live so I made it over here and just kind of started my life over the job that I was quote-unquote promised not really promise but that was told I'd be I'd be hooked up with didn't work out and it wasn't that it didn't work out it was March April when I finally got through to talking to them and they were like I work for in October October so a long ways away if you're in April and needing work right now and obviously I had a lot of debt my investments and trying to get started with this business some poor decisions along the way just a lot of risks that I took that were actually not bad risks they just didn't go well and so I ended up kind of paying that price by like working super hard to kind of just be able to keep my head above water wound up declaring bankruptcy in December which was like one of the best things that I ever did and I even made a video about that eventually once that was all cleared up I and just kind of started my life over here I just took this risk because I want to live in France I want to try and make a life around the art that I love to create predominantly writing like I really just want to spend my time writing books as much as I can but also making videos and eventually making movies like I really want all of that to coalesce into a moviemaking career down the line making movies out of the stories that I have in my head fantasy and science fiction in particular for those of you who are like what is this nerdy guy doing walking around that's that's that but I do also want to write a book here soon he's been asked for repeatedly and I think I'm finally getting an idea of how I do it about this whole experience and now I'm here in Paris just kind of living day to day life my vlog is very much a day-to-day life kind of thing I do like to make videos about touristy things you can do to be helpful because I want to make sure that everybody who comes to Paris has the best time possible being here it's a city that can be a little bit overwhelming and sometimes unwelcoming even if you know what you're doing and so helping people to get an even better idea of what they're doing how to get around the city how to appreciate it isn't it's near and dear to my heart because I love the city's the city is near and dear to my heart and that's basically that that's an overview like the things are really important to me are the writing vlogging I really love doing this I love talking to you directly like this is really really cool it's really cool opportunity I love Paris traveling is important to me but not in and of itself like I love to travel because it helps me to better understand the world around me and that informs my writing that informs my worldview which i think is really like really really valuable it's invaluable I used to do these bike tours here in town you can actually see them wrapping up right over here there's Jonathan telling his stories Jonathan's a French American he's fun guy he's wearing his French flag still to that's amazing [Music] visible spectra that I used to do in a lot of videos from last year as well so the things that I want from life at this point are really to get to a place where I'm almost there I'm getting very very close to the creative career that I want to have I'm a little bit of a jack-of-all-trades I love to write to draw to make movies I would love to get back into music isn't that music would take a lot more effort than I think I have time for at the moment unfortunately just sit down here by the water look at this what they just pushed these blocks off and what if this happened last night France won the World Cup last night if you're living under a rock so all kinds of chaos has ensued whoo this is very toasty on the buttocks but ideally I think at this point I really want Paris I know that I want Paris to be my home base I feel at home here I love this city and it makes it really easy to travel especially around Europe so this is a great spot to be and I have a wonderful opportunity my visa lasts for four years just to tie that up in case you're wondering legally I'm able to work I am able to pursue my art here and actually they want to see that I'm paying taxes on my art here that's one of the requirements is that what I'm doing here actually makes money otherwise they kick me out and then if that continues to go well I'll renew it in four years and and then I'll apply for citizenship shortly after that and have dual citizenship between the United States and France which opens up the ability to live and work anywhere in Europe as well as the United States you know some things don't go incredibly sideways in the next couple years which we're all I think hoping does not happen so that should get you fairly well caught up like I said I volunteered on a hospital ship in West Africa for a few years so I have random friends all over the world through that I had a lot of things that I would like to be doing a lot of places I'd like to be going there's just a lot I'm really excited to share that adventure with you as things go along one of the key principles of the vlog that I always try to maintain too is just to be honest and as authentic and vulnerable as they can be in the sense that I'm really trying to never hide anything or lie about anything unless you like it's unsafe or certain arenas somebody in comments yesterday made an allusion to this or didn't even make an allusion straight up asked but I don't talk about like my relationship stuff because I will let you know I am straight and I am single but that's about as far as I'll go on that just because yeah I don't know it's a - it's a two person thing right so I don't want to undercut the other person's rights and privileges in a relationship like I'd like to protect that and if somebody I do have a girlfriend who's like stop solid steady is my girlfriend well then I'll let you know when that day comes I suppose but until then like I just want to talk about it because I'd know on a Taylor Swift myself more or less no offense Taytay if you see this but I don't want to bad news so just kind of leave that off the table but aside from that I mean I'm sure there are subjects we can come up with that I don't really want to talk about but for the most part I'm an open book and I think that's really important because for me especially like my blog it's been an exercise in development for myself as well development professionally and my storytelling and my video production abilities like actually growing as an artist so to speak but also as a journal as a way of documenting my life and making sure that everything is actually on paper so to speak there on video but you know it just is what a cool thing to be able to document my life everyday to share that and then you be able to go back and look at it later me like oh yeah that's what I was doing right that's where I was or that's what I was wearing whatever it is not that I have very many clothing options to choose from but that's I don't know I'm just I for me it's really important that I am as honest as I can be just for my own sake because for the first year of making this there were very few people that were watching anyways and so it wasn't really even that much about sharing outside of my close friends and family it was a lot of it was just about keeping a good record for myself and I want to keep doing that so if he came here because you saw some craziness or something touristy and you're like oh man I hope that every day he's got the five best something in Paris I'm gonna try and do a lot more of those but a lot of those are to help people find me and then if you want to stick around the core of the vlog the heart of it really is sharing in the journey that is going from being like heartbroken and dead broke hopefully to a wildly successful someday and you know making movies and who knows what all else but who knows what life has in store but I'm really hopeful that I get to share the entire journey with you and and not just the highlights because who wants to watch social media highlight reels anyways that's not real nobody likes that I don't like that at least anyways that's the video for today I figured I'd take a little stroll down here and talk I need to edit that video that I made for Johnny Eve today as well and I trying to get all the thank you stickers sent off to patrons today so had a lot on my plate and just trying to take it a little bit easy of course after the insane weekend we just had well figure it out I got I also got the 40 countries goal to catch up on it if you have no idea what I'm talking about you go back and watch one of the goal videos and you'll see it earlier as well and yeah with that I'm just gonna go ahead and get out of the Sun before I burn and I don't know go home before the the the World Cup yikes the World Cup parade is gonna start in like 45 minutes so I need to try and figure out how I'm gonna get home before that goes and said anyways see you bright and early tomorrow morning for whatever it is man I'm talking about tomorrow morning but I'm a nasty manana [Music]
