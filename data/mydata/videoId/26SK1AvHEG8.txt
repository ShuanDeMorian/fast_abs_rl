 it's kind of insane if you think about it today's vlogging a 1002 that's a mouthful [Music] good morning and welcome to day two of my 20 and 20 what is it 20 and 20 you might be asking but it's gonna tell that story yesterday and I just didn't have enough time I had so much stuff to share from the first to Ronnies month and I couldn't resist making a video that was exactly 20 minutes and 20 seconds long just never really happened the basic idea of a 20 and 20 it's a drinking game originally the idea was that you would go around and in one day have one drink in each arrondissement in Paris all 20 of them and nobody ever makes it nobody survives it's a ridiculous and horrible idea but in spite of being a horrible idea for drinking it's a great idea for Tony how's it going cousin the best bite hi whoever that was is nice to meet you the best part of doing it this way is that I can split up each day it's a lot to explore each or on each month but I can do a combination of exploring and also sharing some highlights from my guide with you downside is that because we're doing every day and we're kind of constrained by you know real-time some of the scheduling issues are gonna crop up like today the first place I'm going to show you is closed which is a huge disappointment because it's the number one thing I wanted to do in this Ronnie's mom but there are sacrifices you got to make if you're gonna stick to it and I'm gonna get this whole thing done in 20 days so if you want to join me today is gonna have a couple of guest appearances as well for my friend Meghan from my friend Oliver maybe from Laura and then you know it's basically gonna be purely food oriented because there's not a lot to see or do in the second Ronnie's mind that's not entirely true there are couple things to see I'm sure there's plenty to do that I may not know about because I'm not invited into the secret cool clubs in the second but in the meantime we've got some awesome street art and this section is fantastic route west on the a turns into route petite Cowell and it turns into a nice little walking district let me show you this [Music] and then we come to a critical juncture it's critical for two reasons one if we continue down the petechial it turns into room monthly which is where we're gonna go with Oliver later because it's his favorite Street and he used to live over here so he wants to help show us that the other thing is Boneshaker doughnuts right behind me so good the best-known it's in Paris that I have had I've yet to have a better doughnut in Paris super disappointing because they're closed on Sundays I I was so excited to come here actually I planned on coming here with both Laura and Oliver we were gonna have a doughnut party doughnut party unfortunately averted in the meantime though there is a delicious croissant on the corner that's in my top five croissants video can't guarantee it is actually one of the best croissants in the city because again there are some secrets around but this one highly highly worth it when you get down here turn on Rue de Neil another adorable Street and just at the end is tasty tasty deliciousness [Music] mr. Saab I got a pen a struggle as well but I'm gonna give that to make him this person Wow I wish this place is in my neighborhood ho ho dear Lord it's so delicious Oh get on to coffee with Megan here's the plan but in the meantime oh I can't I gotta put my sunglasses on Gregor it's not my ham time near to coffee that Matamata Kavi Sun out sunglasses attached let's gear clear-site track I'm gonna be late but this is worth it this is a spot over here the second very close to mata Mata coffee which is where I'm going so that's the hint of the day is the sparkling water water fountain I don't know if you'll remember that from Richard and I stumbled across it but here it is Rue de Montmartre a truly open qua what was that room brew Leopold Bella yep really Apple better we're not here for sparkling water we're here for coffee I can't go on with this Chris not though I need to finish this that'd be rude Paul ma'am that's a good croissant [Music] [Music] all I need is you on the wheel coming in for a really nice picture that would be perfect I think we can make that happen this way you have to do to help Oliver with his Eastern stories this is Oliver he's gonna be walking us through a route through what I'm gonna walk you through what's known in my circles is the best street in Paris and I put my whole reputation on the line I'm looking forward to this okay but first Instagram story [Music] I think I got it yo J Swanson 1,000 bucks plus real and all he finishes coffee and then let's go for a stroll [Music] [Music] [Music] eighty-three but you didn't come here to see us ride wheels you came here to see the second Ronnie's mom if you don't know Oliver yet has the premier english-speaking podcast in Paris told your head I'm good actually I'd love to hold your hand but when I said I was gonna do the second Ronnie's mom Oliver reached out to me and he said dude if you don't do room on to go you're gonna miss out on the best street in all of Paris and I said best street in Paris he said yes I remember you said wasn't it famed writer Alain trelaina who wrote a book about the only street in Paris about Rue de Monte I said that's right J that is exactly what I said in this situation but she was wrong oh my gosh she'll only Street in Paris yeah rue months are good we're gonna go check it out right now we're gonna get all of his overview on the wisdom of why it's the best street in all of Paris also right now whatever sweet run right now is fantastic for writing wheels this is great I guess every Sunday there's no traffic which is it's already pedestrian street but now it's extremely pedestrian eyes so you look up and down you want to say any cars you see people and what are they doing lining up for some of the best food in the city fish mongers they've got any monger that you want they have it here you even got a paul monger behind you yes a pole manga but that's not in my top three she used to live near here well that's right if I'll show you that straight is my string we should go and look at the door of it let's go look at the door the door behind which the magic used to happen you're from Pullman I am so in Pullman much like in Perth where I'm from we don't have doors like this on buildings like this we have doors like this all over the place in Pullman not sure we don't live behind doors like this Trey let's see if he can get into his old apartment building here there's also one of these apartments is for sale got it no turns out you don't need high security when people can't remember what the codes are in the first place I'm gonna go on about it cuz you can't see it Oh the very top floor there's on Devon do you see that you me in the middle yeah those two windows in front on the left that's where I live no magic this is definitely the highlight of the second tour okay this man but for me at least one of things I really enjoy especially about the center of Paris on the weekends is in the morning and Sundays especially is just dead you just wanted to think this is so quiet we were whispering if you start at the top of the ganas Boneshaker donuts which I showed you earlier is right behind me and then on this side is the top of room on till you lay they've got homemade arch here all the way down and it basically runs all the way to the end of the the southern border of the second and will pop out basically at Sonny's - the church that I showed you yesterday so we will stop before we get to the show we're gonna be rockin it wrong we're not gonna touch the first today I spent enough time there yesterday okay what you need to do if you're taking the metro you get off at some tea which is this one right here you'll pop out into the world under the arch that is where you should begin your journey slightly downhill if you've got a wheel it'll be easier if you just rolling on a scooter also even come with me I'll show you the street Oh what you want a joke yeah Buffett joke well I get nervous too much oats well well then now we can get my reaction in the same show would I yes sir what's the fastest hour on this month in Paris to visit I don't know it's this one it only takes a second [Music] Neal this but we have reached the border of our little tour here we cannot go any further I tried to explain this yesterday but I ran out of time and I also blocked what I was trying to show with my head how you can tell which arrondissement you're in at any given time on the street signs oh here Oliver will point it out on the street signs only when you don't really need it but you've always got the Irani's month right at the top there so we know we're in the second because it's marked on all the street signs and if we look across the street I drew at San Marcel here you can see in the tiny little Napoleon hat across the street that it's the first to Rodney's month so this is the border we're going from second to first not going that far because I mean spent all day there yesterday I don't need to go back but at any given point if you're not sure which are on these Mont you're in look for a street sign check out the little Napoleon hat on top and that should tell you where it is where you are where everything is at that moment so there you have it rue months ago the best street in Paris now you've seen it the second thing is being able to pronounce it and the third thing is being able to spell it I got no idea that's her by Oliver that's the French version of a mic drop this is turning into a very industrious morning hey we lost Oliver which is tragic but we're about to gain a Laura in the meantime I want to go through this roundabout again because we have the opportunity since I did it yesterday in the first it only makes sense that I would do it today in the second and I did look it up yesterday it is Lily the 14th and his Romanesque get glory there space invaders out here - I'm not gonna go Sunday this is amazing I could go around this circle forever I'm gonna go around one more time I was gonna say I'm not gonna do this for I'm gonna do this at least one more time and then I'm gonna meet Laura for lunch it's a sinkhole Armand which is in my guide that's the plan at least we'll see if we find something else we're gonna stumble into you haven't gotten my guide yet I have a guide that breaks down all my recommendations around ease my way around yzma all around the city as well as a bunch of essays on where to stay how to avoid scams all that kind of good stuff so we're gonna go to lunch maybe find a place for a drink I have some cocktail bars and stuff that I've referenced in the guide but it is Sunday and I'm not really sure that we're gonna stick around for that so I'm just gonna wander around the streets a little bit on my wheel see if I had any more space invaders and they'll get lunch [Music] [Applause] [Music] I've never been inside the Opera Comique before wonder if it's as funny as it sounds this is great I'm already really enjoying this whole 2020 thing just because I'm gives me the perfect excuse to go out and explore a whole bunch and I wish I could do it on Sunday everyday because the streets are Mahim ii also brings you right up to the Opera it doesn't include the Opera the famous opera the opera garnier so we'll have to save that for another time in the meantime it's time for lunch one of the things the second does have going for it and I have been to a couple these is there are stand-up comedy clubs smaller theatres lots of them they're just kind of all over the place so if you do want to go see a show this is a neighborhood for you definitely walk around a little bit I've been in this one don't catch a show you might want to see what a little bit of French stand-up comedy is like [Music] it's very cold so it's ramen weather and she's just been reintroduced to wait Paris to pursue never had longer I've only ever been Roman at one place okay this is the first place I ever had ramen in Paris so it's a good con it's a good time get introduction what's here what's review so it was this is the only the second place I've ever had ramen though this job sure comparison said the other place that one is still my number one I can see that I actually think I would agree I think her favorite one is the better one to do but you'll have to wait and find out about that later it's a this at my guide dog I put it in my updated guide so you could cheat and find out right now if you go by my guide right now that's the call to action I'm gonna show you one more place whaler I'm gonna show you one more place is closed today and they don't know really open till five o'clock anyways but it's my favorite Tap House in the second and that's really the last place which is disappointingly not open on Sundays but is in my guide his happy corner which is a fantastic little Tap House there are like 20 taps or something lots of taps very good anyway it's really good spot come and have a beer it's great we would have like a beer to end the day but it's sadly closed that's the second this is where I started it's a very small around it's not easy to get around fantastic all around yeah it's wonderful just come bounce around it'll be great I will see you bright and early tomorrow morning for the 3rd around he's mine we'll see what we discover in that hopefully just some good time exploring see tomorrow [Music]
