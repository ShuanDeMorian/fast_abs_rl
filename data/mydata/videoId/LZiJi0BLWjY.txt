 hey everybody its loggin a 522 daddy [Music] four miles for miles and who knows how much time because my running app will not let me sign in even though I've reset my password I'm new blogging the website through my phone but I'm not in for the rent logging to be happy for whatever reason no idea why it just kind of hates me this is fun though this first time I've run with music and probably a year which is nice makes a huge difference it's wireless earbuds that my sister got me are awesome they have a hard time connecting I give this connection when I turn to look over my shoulder I think that just the left shoulder not the right shoulder no idea why but aside from that they're awesome running app no sugar they give me a hard time every time I get sugar so I'm using that as my motivation to stop putting sugar in my coffee no sugar in my coffee yesterday either better I also got a stopped drinking coke I never show that a drink coke really because I don't really want to put up with the comments that would come out of that but it's definitely one of my vices are they my only I mean their worst places to have the genuine coke but definitely not good for you and especially since I would like to lose weight gotta stop [Music] but I'm gonna actually turn this into some Tartine cousin gem that I'm pretty sure isn't expired yet guess we're about to find out seems healthy [Applause] darky terrific I got some voice acting recorded although I might have to rerecord it tomorrow when I go in to get it done at CNRS Oh stretch because I also I'm really hungry post run hunger on top of having not really eaten much is a good time to go get lunch I also just finished I got a random job editing video for a guy it's like a present for his mom it's really actually a sweet it's a really sweet scripted video that he did just put the footage all together with some music and you know edited it all together so I just uploaded that for him as well just took me I don't know an hour and a half two hours to put together so that's cool I just random random freelance video gigs so it's been a very productive morning to say the least and I need to make it a very productive afternoon as well but first thing needs lunch and then I kind of want to get out of here and go somewhere in town but the peloton is closed and it's already the afternoon we'll see maybe we'll go do something but staying here and getting work done sounds okay to me right now cuz I haven't been here for a while and so I'm not feeling super claustrophobic let's go get I needed there's some weird problem with my bank I I don't know what's wrong with the debit card situation but I needed to transfer some money back to my banking out in America the service won't let me for some reason because it says my bank is being a jerk so I wanted to see them they're closed of course wait what's today Wednesday why are they closed on a Wednesday Monday I can see Wednesday anyways as you might have noticed in the last you know whatever and as your comments have made clear my two main goals right now to get caught up on work and to get caught up on sleep because those are two things that fallen well behind on I just took a nap like a series of small naps that lasted like an hour I'm not actually sure but it was really really nice and I do feel like I'm getting really caught up on my work although I have what did you I'm feeling pretty feeling to feel on top of it which is good tonight we're gonna go visit some friends I'm gonna be house-sitting for I'm gonna be doing some house-sitting a lot of house-sitting over the next week and a half particularly for friends who have pets that need to be watched while they're away and tonight we're gonna go meet a new one that I have not met yet which is it's a pug and we'll find out more together because I've been told that he's blind and deaf and therefore needs a little bit of extra help especially when you know meaning you go outside and anger in the bathroom so okay I'm looking forward to meeting you Oh all that to say it also means that the blog's also might be a little bit shorter this week this is a drink conserve some time and spend that time specifically on sleeping for those of you who are freaking out I'm not sleeping enough I I hear ya I feel it I'm making some changes on that so we want to go I want to go check that out I also want to before I go they live up in the 18th and on the way I would really like to go see if the Christmas market is a sec recur or not because I've been told that it's gonna be up but I've also been told that it's not up so I was told that was going up before I left like a couple days after I left and I've been recently told that it's not there I want I need to know because I I want a Christmas market to happen at least one that's very small Christmas market right off the best which is on line 12 let me check it out the one that's usually up there wasn't the one that I'm pretty sure is not there is that that one's really small I've never actually seen that one before is up near sacre coeur usually there's one every year the big white church on the hill I'm hoping that it's up but I've been told it's not so we're gonna go investigate and then after that we'll go to dinner but in the meantime I mean I hope it's up it's it's a really fun spot for Christmas market let's really dark up here I'm afraid the rumors are true normally you're just up here to the left of the church no good not looking like it's no Christmas market that's exactly where it would have been and up here to like this whole empty street right here is empty because there's supposed to be a Christmas right here sad yes depressing I don't I don't like that they decided not to do this I understand they're scared weird about terrorist attacks that kind of stuff but it's lame the church here often does stuff to you looks like they're kind of setup or something really small not really set up either a nativity bubble over that of its kind of fun and then the artists Square is still all sparkly which is nice but still not a Christmas market I don't know why I went for a straight gram all boys I'm worried too we're trying out a new a cream that we're not sure actually there's no chunks in it a lot of chunks well let's stir quicker and see if it gets rid of the choke this is kind of an investigation to see whether or not this kind of cream is actually a coffee friendly clean I'm guessing yes now that you've mixed it enough maybe are you willing to drink this absolutely if you get horribly oh I'm so sorry well if I get her Bo yeah wow that looks like a starry night it's not usually how I drink my coffee but you know I'll take it [Music] no this is very um you want to try it it's like it's tribal it's not it's not bad it's just kind of weird yeah not bad but just kind of odd and I'm not sure if it's because it's like the combination with the coffee or if it's the actual milk itself I mean is drinkable just add some sugar maybe and it'll be fine or rum apparently Oh Bailey's this coffee is gonna get way better really quickly all right we walked the monster his name is badger you're gonna get to know him here soon because I'm gonna be dog sitting this weekend he's ridiculously adorable and he's completely blind in death which is he's just funny and the way she described it he literally has and no self-preservation skills so we'll have to watch out for him anyways those nice we had dinner they showed me around show me what I gotta do to keep the dog alive and I'll be doing that here in a few days until then we're still in my place so their apartments awesome it's gonna be fun to explore it and the neighborhood I love the 18th I love this neighborhood so I'm really really excited to spend some more time here and I have some ideas so we'll see how that goes anyways time to go back if you haven't subscribed yet please do subscribe like
