 today is blog day 965 [Music] good morning and round two supposedly well definitely if attempting to eat on this podcast hopefully actually get on this podcast this morning yesterday for French Friday which I didn't actually call it French Friday because I got out of the frame as fast as I could but we celebrate International Women's Day we talk about whether or not Kurtz was safe today we're going to enjoy a real Friday we're gonna enjoy a real Friday by learning how to improve our lots a art with my buddy Fox over it good news coffee and that's gonna be great first I have to do this podcast which means I need something to eat huh stay alive all right REE good morning thanks for guy's mother word Cali guys podcast is a lot of fun is just but we actually just sat and basically talked for about two hours they had a lot of questions is really neat too it's fun to go on a podcast where people actually have seen it right the video the podcasts have gone on there like so woody and so it's just fun we had a really good time and it seemed like some really great guys anyways I will link to that below I will a link to them but I'll also link to it whenever it goes live on Twitter of course and then on my blog that day assuming that I see it on time and I'll be sure to share that with you guys today right now like I said I'm gonna go I'm headed to good news coffee the other thing I want to do is I want to check out the new wall around the Eiffel Tower and see if I can't get my wheels for security or if that's a no-no find out [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] good coffee a good news as always I'm gonna go check it was too crazy in there so you've already probably figured out cuz the title of the film was not like how to improve your latte art I was too nuts in there to do it so we'll come back and do that again another time but the coffe that but that carrot cake was delicious I'm gonna head over to the Eiffel Tower see if I can get my wheel through security and I gotta find lunch sometime soon cuz I I'm not hungry super hungry yet but you know I'm gonna be by the time [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's good to see that the clipboard scammers haven't given up yet you know that'd be kind of sad if they stopped I mean how else would you you know that you're an authentic Paris somebody wasn't trying to scam me with a clipboard I thought I'd come down and check out the security setup down here now that they've been working even working on this forever for like a year year and a half something like that this wall this glass wall on my right is actually not nearly as ugly as I thought it was except for this section right here that section is not so great either but most of it's pretty nice it's a tragedy that it has to be here the reason it's here is because some dude walked in under the Eiffel Tower the bomb in his backpack a few years ago and I like okay well we can't do that anymore more clipboards scam artists but with the glass here now instead of like the big monstrosity that was here for a while the head like an opaque fence for a long time it doesn't look too bad it does mean that you can't wander through freely anymore which is tragic because used to be able just walk straight under the Eiffel Tower at your leisure which was glorious and now you either got to go around or you got to go through security to get in that is my other goal today I don't think I'm gonna be able to film exactly what security entails but we have security over here and I was kind of curious if I could get my wheel inside I guess the quick answer would be just to ask if they'll let me in they've got like a metal detector I feel the pass to remember the detector no problem let's give it a try right away there are two lines one for people with tickets and one with out tickets so if you get your tickets in advance it's gonna make your trip in faster I can tell you that much turning into an Eiffel Tower video I didn't didn't know that this is not how I thought the day was gonna go [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] yeah if they're not gonna allow Gustav's or rollerblades I have a high suspicion that the wheel won't make it any there I'll ask these security guys really quickly and just to be sure which is too bad cuz you know this has been a doozy anything if this had been like you know two three years ago and ahead of my wheel I've been able to ride around like crazy under there it'll been amazing you say odd but you can't go in for free and get through security at least go look at the Eiffel Tower from underneath you know better than nothing going up it's worth it once in your life I'm not gonna be doing that anytime soon though hopefully again I made a video about that already go check that video out I'm not doing that today I asked the security dude and he said no say I'll tell D which means no it's forbidden send such a such a dramatic word every time in French person tells me that about anything I just immediately want to rebell which that's the American in me what can I say that's tragic the great tragedy in my life you also see a bunch of these really big pylons preventing cars from jumping in which is good you don't wanna get run over by a car while you're here otherwise place is calm miss Jill it's better I don't know I'm not a fan again of the fact that we need to have this wall here but the fact that it's glass it's very tastefully done at very minimalistic makes me feel much better about it and while it might ruin the fun of being able to just walk under the Eiffel Tower and ever you feel like it at least we're safe suppose there's always that and you know now now it's time for lunch [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I will say that this this is so much nicer now that all the construction is done this area has just been a giant cluster for so long it's been so hard to like to even want I don't even want to walk through here usually so now that that's done I mean in peak season tourist season this place is a madhouse anyways but way nicer Thank You Paris for putting that together I'm happy happy that we've got a little bit more security you just got to pass the chariot here hey Annie here or alright well that solves that series of questions no wheels underneath but at least everything is very close to being completed it looks like they still have some construction offices in containers underneath it so maybe they're not quite there yet but hopefully shortly all that construction will be a thing of the past a nightmare that we can all put behind us and go back to living our quaint little lives [Music] progress is being made on the old washing machine finally plumbers on his way felix is working on his thing right now i just getting it all prepped up and ready to go i'm gonna get out of here so i'm out of their hair go work somewhere else the day is try not to be very nice i really enjoying i'm really enjoying the wheel the better I get on it the more fun I have with it at last so wait a wheel away from here but it's about to sit get some work done on my computer because I definitely need to finish up a lot of things that might actually wrap things up here unless of course you see Bhushan in which case I'll let Prashant be the end screen today now see brightness morrow morning for whatever glorious things await us here in Paris on a Saturday og vision there's not very many of them left how would worry about it but still look my dirty laundry through the streets of Paris anymore this is great thank you rob and thanks to Felix and the plumber who will probably never see this but thanks to them nonetheless already texted them and thank you this is amazing I put a small load and I'm gonna have to go get on a drying rack for myself but like I'm really excited oh man and I'm home this is great anyway we're just like one or two steps away from being able to finish this place as far as we're gonna be finishing it and that is oh man it just I'm really interested to hear how loud this thing actually is it's not loud at all I will see you bright and early tomorrow morning for us sparkling we cleanly clothed the day here in Paris and I hope that you're having a wonderful time of it wherever it is you are like it's probably better like this see tomorrow [Music]
