 it's long a 621 it's Friday which means it's time for French Friday and today we're gonna be doing something I've been meaning to do for a while just go for havin gun for under well but we're gonna combine that with five great photos of the Eiffel Tower most of them gonna be just a little bit out of the way just stumble across one or two of these on your own I'm sure but a lot of them you won't and all it takes is a little bit of extra effort to get out of your way and go see them I'm gonna combine it with a run because I have other work I really need to be getting done today and so I want to get on top of that as quickly as possible so I don't to spend all day walking around to go to the Eiffel Tower as much as I'm privileged to be able to do so so if you'll forgive me for going for a run in the middle of showing you a bunch of nice photos of the Eiffel Tower let's do that I will of course link below on Google Maps to the locations of all of these photos where I took the photos that is when you're here in Paris or if you already live in Paris you can replicate them to your heart's content very well worth it ready let's go oh yeah this doesn't count but behind me is Trocadero Trocadero has its own metro stop it's ridiculously easy to get to and it's probably the most iconic recognizable shot of the Eiffel Tower it's really easy to get shots of yourselves your friends your family no the problem is you have to compete with a lot of tourists the later the day it gets the harder that gets of course if you gain her first thing in the morning nobody's here so they do lots of fashion photography posting the morning but not too far from here there are a couple of really great spots and I'm gonna show you those let's go this is great shot of the Eiffel Tower there is scaffolding here right now hopefully by the time you get here there won't be if you're coming tomorrow there will be this is a great shot though because you have some amazing buildings in the foreground right that are beautiful a little bit varied they've got just a little bit of that eclectic collection feeling that Paris is apt to give you as well as that guitar fairly close and looming in the background which is really really nice and of course is the trees start to blossom and we start to get leaves and everything else on them you're gonna be in really good shape this is very close to Trocadero nobody finds this there's probably a photographer out there somewhere like the guy behind me right now who's gonna want to kill me for giving this one away but it's yours now too so enjoy [Music] it's also really important to remember that lighting counts so some of these shots today are gonna be better shot in the evening some of them are gonna be better better shot in the morning good morning or noon time is about the time that I'm at right now you can tell that it's kind of backlit so coming here and having the Sun coming from the other direction the West better in the evening just just for the record [Music] this one depends entirely on your lens don't worry if you just have a cell phone I'm gonna show you some better options if you do have a really nice light like a long lens there are some really great compositional elements here you have two bridges two separate bridges that have two different metro lines running on them which you can catch and it's really really nice at night even though you're not really supposed to take photos a day for Tyra at night you also have sacre-coeur off in the distance so if you can zoom in really well you can see sacre-coeur in the distance over the bridges next to the Eiffel Tower it's a great shot the other nice thing of course is that the Statue of Liberty the largest Statue of Liberty in Paris is just over here so you can get a bonus shovin Statue of Liberty while you're here and impress your friends with your knowledge of how there are multiple sections of Liberty in Paris we're gonna go run through the other ones now that you'll see as we get closer that each bridge that we go by or under or through has its own unique take on the Eiffel Tower and it's really really nice so if you come all the way out here you'll reward yourself with a nice walk through a whole bunch of more photos and this counts as spot number two [Music] this one ranks among the more obvious you'll see there are a lot of people out here now the trick is though even though it's obvious get as far away from the Avatar as you can you'll notice the running shots that I took aside came closer and closer I guess how farther and farther but got closer to this spot I couldn't get the whole life of tower in it because my cell phone is that limited you have to if you want to get the whole Eiffel Tower you got to go almost all the way to the end of the Champ de Mars not quite all the way to the end of the Trump to Mars but pretty close and then you can get a nice shot and yeah I mean this one this one counts as obvious but I can't they can't all be hard [Music]  in this is a great one especially we have a wide angle it's a little bit harder this cell phone but not so bad in portrait mode and if you can she said avatar behind right now wonderful shot though and if you go just a little bit farther that way to make up for the fact that I included the shelf bars you get another one where the building's frame it even better that is incredible easy too you just have to go about half a block er just over away from where we started there out from the Eiffel Tower have a nice of a restaurant here with some chairs and stuff very fronts say even though the building immediately next to us is actually kind of ugly but that's ok you don't have to put that in your photo yeah what hour is what matters okay that is a bonus spot I'm gonna cheat one more bonus spot on the river again here before I show you my final spot of five great spot to take a photo of the Eiffel Tower and if this doesn't do it for you yes I tried this bridge is obviously pretty easy to find right next to palais de tokyo so i'm going to show you the last photo spot a little bit less obvious it's funny which ones are more easily found than others but it's a great shot on a bridge not so bad if you want this bridge in the photo to go one more bridge down you start taking photos of pilings don't well that's a good option there you go bonus 2 or bonus 3 this is a bonus as well pretty easy to find you find this on your own [Music] don't let the location of the skiers stairs stairs stairs fool you there's a really good spot just about like 2 meters that way this is actually a fantastic location easy to find there's a spaceman theater right next to it little one easy one I don't show you you gotta find it on your own and I mean there's a lot of really nice to be zoomed around here too so when you're done taking photos of that tower let's go into the modern art museum it's literally right here which makes it a little bit easier unless you don't know what you're looking for and there's another nice view from inside of it too [Music] I didn't have my running app running for like half of that but I got I think about 4 miles out of it not a bad run all in all but that gives you 4 5 6 7 8 some number of great views benefit are you can take a photo from easily fill up your Instagram story fill up your snapchat a few students will use snapchat have a great time taking photos and you know explore a little bit get out of the way we just did a full 360 on the Eiffel Tower if you enjoyed this I thank you video literally every day I'm falling every day about life in France Travel expat life riding all kinds of things say about the subscribe button if you haven't already otherwise if you have and you're already familiar with all this watching it because now it's time to continue actually vlogging for the rest of the day I gotta get some work done and then it's time for dinner with Natasha we finally finally getting our Indian food is staying forever [Music] now those of you who aren't sure that you're ready to commit to you know an entire daily vlog thing I have posted a number of links to other helpful Paris tips if you're looking to spend some time in Paris like how that visit the Louvre is their fault our how to use the Metro I don't know there's probably some other stuff in there hopefully you find it helpful for those of you who joined for the live edit last night thank you so much was really fun we broke two records and bought me two beers super chat went nuts and we got over a hundred likes in the end on on the edit wallah was live which we're kind of it says we said if we if we broke $25 across five people on the super chat I would have a beer that was blown out of the water if we got 90 likes which would break the record for likes I would have a beer also did pretty well didn't blown out of the water but we did cross 100 and then 7,500 euros on the Kickstarter during the span of the livestream didn't if I make it we did get to like 70 300 euros which is pretty insane and today it's at just under seventy seven hundred euros on the Kickstarter you know what I'm talking about there's a link below to my Kickstarter it's the last day by the time you're seeing this there's only probably a few hours left if any time left on it so if you wanted to grab a book or an audiobook whatever floats your boat now's the time to do it I'm also going to be adding an audio book only option that I did not have in there before people had requested it I totally forgot to put it in there it was requested again I'll get it in there as soon as I eaten and then I'm gonna go sit down and work and get some coffee because I've had any coffee yet today so with that I think we're all cut up definitely made my tear ring a little bit when I snap my finger like that oh my gosh the other thing of course is that this place is turning into a giant construction zone and because I've been wanting to redo the goal board revisit it here soon anyways we're gonna repurpose this and then have it under construction if you didn't see last night in the vlog gonna be all the way to the end alley my work wife came and took half my furniture she took both of the chairs that were destroying my shirts as well as the sewing desk she was very happy with all of it she's probably coming back for the dresser at some point no my stuff is steadily ending up on the floor so hopefully that serves as motivation to get on top of the whole room to Chateau bottle but I really do want to revisit the goal board and reassess things put the dreams back in order get some goals set up and I really want to talk about a little bit more not-too-distant future so that's on the way but in the meantime it's going to serve as a Construction sign because this room is a giant mess food and coffee I might not have brought a jacket with me because I was enjoying the sunshine and now I'm paying for it cuz it's starting to rain [Music] my favorites [Music]
