 [Music] afternoon guys so we are here celebrating our anniversary and we are at a lunch and you have to check out this view it is a beautiful day here in [Music] I just want to show you my cappuccino yes it kind of looks like a dessert but it's not look how thick this foam is it's nice though [Music] so as you can see obviously a very popular spot even though it is freezing or cold we're getting our sweet little wedding shots as you can see because we have this magnificent view so hubby and I are going to walk down and shops the Mars which is just that area there [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey guys I'm standing like the old because in his boot across the right know that at all so I just saw the Missoni window and this Lorex thing seems to be a bit of a trend and this jacket as you can see here is 1840 and I just picked up one very very very similar at H&M obviously not as nice but I'm quite happy with it how beautiful is Paris at night [Music] I'm in gallery we are going to checkout I love Christmas [Music] we'll stroll down shines and he said [Music] wishing [Music] see [Music] [Applause] hey guys so I have a couple of purchases from the root and box for that I will review that I will reveal soon but this is containing the staircase and the apartment of Coco Chanel upstairs which only select people can actually view but still I'm so thrilled to be able to be back here on the staircase again and these are the different choices with you here so the black and brown colorway and the inside is black so this one is very similar but the inside will be tan so I'm definitely looking at this as an option because I don't have a tote the never for never kind of worked out for me so let's take a look and see if this one will [Music] regime and this one is plate this is the twenty second twenty and this one is the one to see and this is Kovac Gabrielle Gabrielle absolutely so simply here and inside is beautifully lined with goat skin so we always use noble material we don't use any cardboard or plastic to reinforce our bags it's all our bags are 100% fully leather lined and leather reinforced and leather reinforced this one take to me this one takes a little bit longer we would say an extra day longer gabrielle was like 20 hours this is like another day yes in 34 days to make about yes no wonder it's so rare yes and the fact that it's really really hand stitched sometimes they have to go back and undo the stitching and they always wax they wax each thread to make sure that the to make sure that the thread will smoothly go through and not get tangled or break so that is also a detail of a French know-how just kicking out that's your market so as you can see there's lots of little shops clothing shops little bits and pieces you guys know how much I love market [Music] [Music] [Music] so we're gonna be trying some French solder I believe I don't know what in run time is but yeah how cool is this so our crepes have arrived and I've got the sweet crepe which is like a banana and cream and caramel sauce and how we've got a savory crepe and honestly I don't know everything that's in there but there definitely is changed [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so this is so beautiful I don't love that beat strong hey guys I mean them is I'm trying for the first time this top and I really like it so this is just this good don't mind my tight like this sort of draping in here it's really good this is the dress version in the blue I actually don't really like it it looks a bit sake on me I think maybe of you look I think if you belted it up it could be quite cute see I mean I do a little bit more of a waist it's okay but not in this state trying on this family's coat and oh my goodness I really like it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] other colors too [Music] I think there was this is another hippo with a little bit of exotic [Music] good afternoon guys our second last day in Paris I'm so sad I know that it was going to be a really quick trip but it's just gone by all too quickly we are off to lunch now and it's not raining today looks a little bit more grey skies we're just having such a good time but I kind of don't want it to end [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so delicious the the food here had been so I've got the muscles and card which looks delicious and hobbies got the roast chicken YUM [Music] you must replace the steak and the chips are awesome as you can see it's like 10:30 now and people are still coming in at the door so we love it a second time you good morning everyone so unfortunately today is our last day and we are spending the last couple of hours strolling through the Luxembourg Gardens this would have been so so pretty and spring but it's still pretty immortelle I'll just show you what I'm saying now oh look at the ponies they're so cute this one's sleeping this one's not sleeping hello [Music] this is such a pretty pretty garden look at that there is hubby there he is so look at this beautiful greenery behind me okay that's probably the only greenery there but it looks so nice see people would be sitting down I'm sure in summer I'm standing up on a stool but even behind meeting you see all those more they kind of like brown now but there would be amazing in someone [Music] hi everyone so we're at the airport sadly our wake trip has come to an end I hope you've enjoyed coming shopping with me eating seeing some of the sides I seriously had the best time ever even though the trip was super short I just loved every minute of it and I hope you enjoyed coming along with me as well I'm so great hey everyone now you have to excuse this a tired face because we have just been on a 13 hour flight and we've got a long transit in Singapore but as you can see there are a lot of shops behind me I'm gonna go get something to eat maybe a massage and then check out a couple of the store even see they also have Burberry Gucci Prada trying to be endured I see a star as well much take a quick blow too so just in Singapore Airport having a look at some of the YSL range and this is the this is the croc in the sunset and in the blush the cab is bad and this is the new titustown anyway this is of the sunset walk which is really cute but it does not fit in iPhone 7 plus but super super cute and that's what I will try for me [Music] and then if I turn this around this is the normal sunset so this to me is a much better size and this definitely does fit in iPhone 7 process that's what this one looks like and I think the sunset is actually really cute guys this is receptors your and this is in the Nano side so I just got told by the sales associates that this is the traditional version which was in 2012 but this is a newer version which is 2017 which is called the supple sakta jaw and as you can see the construction it is a lot softer within this is a lot harder more in this [Music] me and this is the baby which really does not look like a baby's very her good worksite sort of bad [Music] [Music] and this is the West Hollywood bag but this is the smaller size which only came out this year previously it was in this medium size and that's a different weather again this is like a grain to leather which is coated and scratch resistant and so the feature about this bag is it has got this hidden compartment here as you can see and then adjustable shoulder strap as well here are some of the brooches are really quite like this one and then some of the deconstructed brooches the ring there are some of the card cases oh I like the gray one there is a new color so the beige and the gold which is nice as well I've never seen this massive version of the Kate bag as well this is the large size which was launched in 2017 as well and yeah this is a lot bigger probably equivalent to the Jumbo it's just one compartment here like this we can't see but yeah it's just one compartment looks huge but it probably can't store that much I mean it hands still quite a bit but not as much as the Jumbo so that is just the large size for those of you still wanting the wire cell but you thought that the medium Kate tassel was too small because that's the one I have which is this size here and it looks similar to the Chanel medium large but the capacity wise it is definitely less [Music] so adjust in Zara doing some shopping for hobby and I'm pretty impressed with this sort of velvety bomber it's got this bit of lyrics and look at this lining it's really nice as well so going to get that bomber for Hobby and I saw this massive document cloud clutch I think that looks so much more expensive than it is so we're gonna get that as well I'm gonna get our Sun a couple of t-shirts and things and I think hobbies just trying on a couple more shirts I've got a ate a little bit of Singapore straight food and I'm having bucket err [Music]
