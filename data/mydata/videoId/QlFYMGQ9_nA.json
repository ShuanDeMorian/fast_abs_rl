Like any city, there will be sketchier nooks and crannies even in the &quot;good spots&quot; but if you look in the 1st-6th arrondissements, you should be fine. With the exception of the 7th, with the Eiffel Tower, and the 18th, with Sacre Coeur, generally the further out from the centre you go, the more residential and less touristy it gets. When you find a potential spot, look it up on google maps and you can check out that area using street view. Hope that helps! :)",
