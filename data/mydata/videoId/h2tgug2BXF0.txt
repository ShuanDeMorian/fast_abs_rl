 I'm down with holiday extras travel guides and this time we're here to help you travel better in Paris coming up we'll be looking at food transport money some tips on the locals and a whole lot more but first it's the more about the city Paris is one of my favorite places in the whole world with its grand buddha bars friendly locals and first-class cuisine this city really has it all one the best fiction a parody is how close do paris is connected to London by the Eurostar trains depart from some Pancras International in London stopping an absolute international and passionate internationally intent along the way train start running at 5:40 a.m. and run every 60 s from 90 minutes until 8:00 p.m. you'll need your passport to take it ready to pass through airport style security before you can board the train however you can take two bags and there's no weight restrictions to worry about there's an onboard cafe that sells hot food and drink and some modern trains even have Wi-Fi all in all the journey takes about two and a half hours the Oberstar arrives at Paris garden or from here you can take a metro or a taxi to your hotel we'll have more on the metro later now if you're flying in there are routes from most airports in the UK and a flight would take between one and two hours you'll either land in shell de Gaulle in the Northeast or the smaller parent all in the south to get into the city from Chartres Gaulle Airport you can take line B of the RER two trains take about 35 minutes to Paris garden or where you can find connections to the metro and other public transport from all the airport you can connect to line B of the RER line as well although you'll need to take the all eval shuttle service from the airport to anthony train station first however both airports are served by air france's transfer buses there are two lines from Sharda Gul into the city one from Paris Orly and a line that connects the two as with most cities we recommend getting about on foot besides being eco-friendly it's a great way to get a feel for the city just bear in mind that Paris is big like really big a walk from the Eiffel Tower is not done will take a good hour fortunately if your staff a time there are great public transport lengths the subway system is split into the metro and RER line tickets will work across both so you treat it as one big underground network in our experience it served a purpose which was to get us around quickly it's just not the cleanest the metro has 16 lines each with a different color rather 5re our lines are assigned letters a B C D and E are ER and metro trains run every day from 6:00 a.m. until half past midnight as the ticket a single journey if one gyro 90 we bought a book of 10 for 14 euros 50 now there are weekly and monthly passes available but in my opinion register fast you need a passport photo and everything else so I should say book of ten hits straight forwards and forgetting around we recommend it at 15 but in your final destination and it works out the most efficient route oh by the way protip some are er trains are quite short so make sure you're still on the right part of the platform and don't find out the hard way like we did in a world we use the hurry up yes tabs identified by the official taxi for the end sign on the roof of the car if it's red it's busy if it's green it's available it doesn't have this sign don't you this and the minimum fare is 7 euro when walking 3G coverage has been alright meaning that Google Maps directions have been as reliable as ever of course if you get really stuck the Eiffel Tower works at an excellent reference point French food what does that mean to you frog legs snails fine wine cheese baguettes and croissant after spending some time in Paris we can tell you that it's so much more here food is a massive part of the culture in fact there are more Michelin stars in Paris than any other Europe entity one of my favourite restaurants is LaBute a door on the south side of the cen opposite not for Dom after eating manager tebow de tu told me how they get fresh ingredients every day we have a special Lavelle in France that we said if you want to put homemade you have to work with fresh food so we are always having ingredients coming every day sure so the cheff depending off I had a great discussion with turbo and I learnt loads about French cuisine but most importantly I really enjoyed my dinner from the night before that Cod they magnifique [Music] the currency here is the euro and while Paris isn't exactly cheap it is in line with

euros basis generally tipping isn't expected and most restaurants without a service charge to your bail anyway by all means if the service is outstanding feel free to tip as much as you like as to
