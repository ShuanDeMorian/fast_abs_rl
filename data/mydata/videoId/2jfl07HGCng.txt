 Oh looks like we're live and it's kind of sunny that's note you're down behind me which is not what was advertised that we were beginning and going to see but we're gonna be wandering up into the quote unquote Latin Quarter here in a minute gonna go see the Pantheon a little bit of the Serb on the outside of jardin de luxembourg cuz I'm sure they already kicked everyone out somebody's beeping over here this these uh these lime scooters they beep a lot so they're mildly annoying Laura's here to join us as well which I can flip the camera out so you can see her she's starved for human interaction so we're gonna give her as much as we can here and we are definitely sunset II here in Paris today so as we go for a stroll hopefully you guys get a delightful feel for what sunsets in Paris look like right now that the Sun is out and glorious which is great hi-c you know Paul good to see you in here Florentina Alex hi RC Ashley good morning dragon I started a minute early well you know God has got to get rolling better early than late that guy's obnoxiously glad you guys are gonna also be subjected to my obsessive annoyance with noise while filming I'm sure while we're doing this so sorry about that hi Amy hey Dixie and more Reggio good to see you rob thank you very much and Eva hi so anyways this is where we're just kind of starting here getting warmed up making sure people are in and watching I've got no no drinking rules for this one because I don't have any drinking plans this one we just had a beer on the river over here which is really nice she had an Imperial Stout a barrel aged stout that she liked okay well what was yours called again there are so there are a lot of really good pair of an increasing number of French and Parisian breweries around that we're definitely enjoying so hey clay Darren from Dublin good to see you we are living the life Jessie it's true hi Heidi Jim good to see you in Toronto Toya Kathy and Malia hope I just said that right hi Simba Theresa toyo newbie Annette loves imperial stouts as well did you find the name no you gave up okay anyway we're all start walking here there are a lot of people out so I'm gonna be doing my best not to film strangers too much because you know people don't like that that was a good shot of that guy going right over my shoulder there where should we go which direction should we take from here though to get there you think we should go straight up here oh we should go through that time that'll be visually stimulating we'll see how long the the sunset lasts for us the lighting is pretty perfect right now see were you about to say like it's gonna last the same amount of time as that's not really good yeah I feel like we're still in quick sunset lands here in the gym that's good I need I should get in the gym hit hairline from over right my patrons voted on a location for a live strong host the Pantheon which is just kind of the most iconic spot in this direction and then we'll see about the cirebon as well a little bit gonna dodge out literally sort of run didn't eat children but you can see if we stop here for a second a little bit of a tendon wall and some towers ahead we'll get to in a sec whoops whoa when zoomed in it overreacts I used to think these towers are all a part of saint-Ã©tienne Dumont but they're not they're actually there's one of them that's right next to it and I don't know it belongs to you so maybe we will discover the mystery behind that Tower today among our goals hey Marion arc Arkansas sorry that you lost me there the tunnel was a dangerous choice we might not have been the best choice I don't know about all you heard I'll repeat a number of things that I just said I'm sure later for newcomers to the stream but hopefully you guys caught the gist of everything I was going to say because that's all that's all they were they had to say now we're just gonna walk in silence for the next 40 minutes it'll be glorious 40 minutes there's not much to see behind us right now so we'll just keep it forward forward facing for the moments which place Oh which oh that does you mexicanas Magnus what does it say it's especially that I can't speak Spanish s Thank You mr. Scylla Davis mexicanas mexicano us whatever it is it looks delicious I like the Eagles in the window they look like tasty eagles okay Mayan Eagles Azteca niggles we're at the Aztecs Mexican in the territory known as Mexico his girlfriend thought that was really funny I wish I had caught that for those of you that watching at home that the scooter that almost killed Laura and I didn't even catch it on film which is not a good friend thing to do because what are you gonna run at her funeral when you're like and the guy ran her over and I was swimming right next to it you can see the tower now you can't stupid bus now you can the tower on top that is on save attending we are here in a second it's one of my favorite churches in the city one of the most underrated churches in the city in my ever stumble opinion unlike this church which is deservedly underrated that's all I have to say about that because I'm all about being harsh on churches today apparently that it deserved it hey Lillian I mean hola good to see you is Ohio frozen over right now the lake probably is love seeing across the resume oh yeah Laura's Laura's in like five different YouTube channels she's woke I got this virus easily ya know you've been on Cheryl's and nobody else's hey - leave it more YouTube famous than all of us I've never been on the way away I've been on shells channel so you're meeting I have grand aspirations grand aspirations in life okay so we have a blue luxury that's actually boulangerie which is nice I'm going to trying to show that hope that guy was trying to get in the shot there we go so this I think is a Henry Kaiser isn't it or not Henry Kaiser Erik Kaiser sorry just trying to get through all these crowds of people so the Erik Kaiser over here a lot of those signs you'll see where it says like the old school golden sign that says what is a business a lot of those get left regardless of whatever takes over from them is actually that kind of a business so sometimes you'll go to like there's one of a new pizza place just opened in the third that says it's a butchery Abu Shetty so it's a butcher shop it is not true it's a pizza place now but they're obligated to keep a distinction or that sign up there because it's a part of the heritage sorry focus issue live streaming always comes with its bundle of problems so that one they lucked out because they took a spot that had a sign that aligned of what they actually do now we're getting start button part of it the campus structure here's a little bit different than like campus where you would actually have like a whole bunch of space dedicated to just one the Paras Saban is actually split between multiple campuses I don't know how many should know that this is one of the the buildings here and one of the towers I was talking about that I used to think belonged to the church we're gonna go see here in a minute it doesn't which makes me a liar to a number of people that I told that that was a part of okay now we got to see if we can get through here this is uncontrolled intersection haha ends win okay cuz again we're taking let's go to the right take a nice little stroll here hi Monica rubbing your favorite area fantastic I like it seriously but where's actually the most beautiful part of Paris I'll take it sure why not I'm not gonna debate anything along those lines think if there are lots of beautiful parts of Paris well what can you do Vic with this with the lighting as it is right now it's kind of hard to argue it's pretty fantastic so we're gonna head up the hill here in a second toward some more sera nuri but also gonna try to get to you at en demo which I think this is the left we want oh and it's named after the mountain of Sainte Genevieve which is a good sign so for those of you that don't know st. Genevieve is the patron saint of Paris and she she saved the city when she was just a child from which one was it from some marauding invader feel like it was I want to say it till the Hun but that sounds yeah I don't think that's correct try remember who it was anyways one of the grand Marauders and yeah she was the patron saint we actually passed her statue on the river not so long ago and I guess basically the church that we're going to is where her relics are theoretically buried baladi they aren't even in the box because during the revolution they dug up her bones and burned them and dumped them in the river what's which one Thunderbolts and lightning very very frightening tasty tasty what do they sell their traditional French food looks like let's we can go get your escargot you've got your crazy violin I don't know V alone what is that crazy violin what is it dog means crazier nuts and you got American flags okay so here we're getting closer to the church I was promising one of my favorite searches in the whole city whoa way to zoom me I did do bike tours but I'm not planning on opening into her company mill hi Stacy wait wait Stacy in Greenville where I've been to Greenville South Carolina I want a hold or her and people are singing songs in here all kinds of good stuff so hey Lane good to see you in here hey Lane Vincent Drive the French is named in the group so far there's also a sign ford delirium here which is a dutch brewery they've been more where those signs around I don't know if there's actually delirium bars opening up no that looks pretty the triple in the IPA that looks promising oh yeah do you have the head right okay we're gonna get a space invader in real time here are we are we oh I already have that one look at that I was gonna be surprised you made one beer in and she's already lost she's lost to us well that's it's good for it's good for a stroll then so stay 19 Newmont right here is legitimately one of the prettiest churches in the city so people know about it I feel like but stumble on it more regularly because it's right next to the Pantheon really really worth it if you come to the Pantheon which we're gonna see here in a second so I just kept trying to get control of my camera but the space invader right here as well on the Bombardier this is well worth coming to see photos being taken by Laura if you want to go follow her on Instagram is it Laura the from Laura the like I knew there's a button there no no if you wanted that out on the internet but there it is it's okay it's a small group of only 120 people but the Pantheon is pretty stunning right now in the light this right here is the bumper here it's in my guide you haven't gotten to copy my God as just a great spot to come grab a pint and if you're gonna watch like a football match or a rugby match or something like that a good spot to do it with cool peeps oh yeah the Pantheon looks great now back to sit at the end of all this church oh did we sneak I think we might have snuck into here during a live stroll once before but you probably do it again now because the the doors are open we're gonna go in but you have to promise to be quiet nobody talked okay cuz if I want to get in trouble I got to take off my hat so hat off and now we're gonna go inside Shh nobody say anything they all know that we're live everybody stay quiet okay we're gonna go check out Genevieve's nan bones now Oh somebody wasn't quite gonna get kicked out you can see up ahead this right here the spirals and the pathways above which I don't think you're real pathways but they look like pathways are one of my favorite features in this place they're gorgeous they're carved out around the home tellers they feel very forest like I don't know why to me just to me a stone forest you know that up there is a relic box that I've never noticed before it and I don't know what's in that I'm really curious the other dialog boxes down here is the one that's for Genevieve's bones and that doesn't have Genevieve in it you can still come see it and you can see the tomb she used to be buried in here it's very Knightly dedicated it's very pretty and to my knowledge only has dust in it Genevieve dust the most famous dust in Paris it's a gorgeous little church I love it better beautiful okay so we're at risk of losing connectivity back here - I think so we're gonna head back outside well give you the side view as we go it's kind of my go on that will start talking again when we get outside nobody make any loud noises we're almost out it smells like a church all these churches are very distinct to smell and I don't know what it comes from but it also they're been forced I've been in forests in France that have the same smell so I don't know if it's the wood that they use I don't know well they've got a lot of wood finishing and they also burn incense get one last look at the ceiling here as we walk out as well Oh and Rebecca and I can speak it at normal my stun glasses and not feel totally self conscious about it hey thanks a lot I appreciate that dear friend thank you for whispering everybody that was a nice little sneak the name of the Church of statement in do mall and there probably are space invaders in the box that is also very possible it is one of my favorites to Suzie Q I love this train definitely worth a visit don't miss it it's also interesting something to point out there's another tower that does not work that right there that does not belong to the church that I always thought did from a distance the church is asymmetrical so you'll see the tower over here is not mirrored anywhere and it's off and there are other elements to the church whoa sorry I'm going the wrong way there are other elements to the church that are also asymmetrical if you come pay attention thank Santa for the coffee fund money appreciate that we'll have to get a beer when we're done here in your honor and all your collective honors hi I am love from Mexico thank you I'm glad you love my channel if you are loved then that's a good sign for the future of my channel I appreciate that this is also this is this library up ahead and random side fact oh you got me Yanni sorry I wasn't able to see any comments were in there because I was being sneaky and filming I mean not that not that it's verboten but I was trying to be quiet and sneaky and respectful this library here I when I was in France when was that it was a while back and I finished I think my second book in here unintentionally I was gonna meet a friend she had some work to do and she wanted to meet in this library but I didn't know at the time is that I had to have like an account to so I had to go through the whole process of getting like a library card and like I told them I was in oh yeah so I was working here I told my was an English teacher I think and they took me on as like a professor of some sort gave me a pat like a two-year library card and I went in and couldn't find her but it's very like Harry Potter esque inside very tall vaulted ceilings whoo thanks Susie Q I'm gonna be very curious to see what color the light in my room is when I get home after all this it automatically get turned on by now I guarantee it but anyways I finished one of my I finished one of my books in this library even though I wasn't really allowed to be in it and yeah it's kind of a fun random story get some more Pantheon shots here over here in the distance you can see the mayor's office of the fifth or Ronny's month looks very nice on the corner there and then the Pantheon which was originally it's kind of juggled and its purposes between it was supposed to be like a church originally and then the city took it back and now it's like more of a shrine to the best and brightest of France so there's only a handful of people buried there I mean Voltaire and a few others so maybe I'll get buried in there one day I doubt it I don't think but you know wakingdream cross over here it's more interesting to go this way straight down there oh yeah we can go towards the shard down to Luxembourg sure but anyways that's the Pantheon behind it sounds like everybody lost me for a minute there and then in front of us is guarding the Luxembourg and a little bit of sunlight sunshine sunset Sun something will get there everybody why is everybody I'm not getting any confirmation that I'm back so and we've dropped down to 70 people now we're back up to 90 people who knows can you guys hear me in the CV hello so thirty seconds ago we got back roughly something like that hi everybody welcome back to the what what I'll did you miss why does it keep dropping when I try to talk about things that I'm actually trying to share so the pantheon behind hey Desiree good to see you too the Pantheon behind and then turn in Luxembourg shortly in front I wonder if we just walked into a really dead spot up against that building oh yeah Space Invader here if you need that that one she Laura help me find that one there are cousins there's another one just down that way hold on down the street over here which is you can't really see we're waiting for the light anyways so there you go actually should we cross and go on that side let's do it get some crossing footage of the old Pantheon and on the other side a big catch up real slow you'll see the Eiffel Tower off in the distance and we're gonna head that way here in a second not all the way that ville tower that would be absurd but you know okay so what I was trying to say was that as wave preview won't don't put the camera right in through the car oh there's another Tower by the way do they serve on tower turn around that one right there that's a more famous one and then you can see tour son Jack down in the distance that's the church that was the church that's no longer a church got torn down during the revolution beautiful tower that you can climb during the summer and I've never done that so this is this is the year I plan on doing it anyways this is the year it's gonna happen now what I was going to say though is that today because I'm doing two streams and doing this stream and then if you want to join up words I'm gonna stream a game on twitch because I was gonna stream this live stroll on Twitch and then I realized that's probably a false promise because most the time I spend on Twitch is playing like scary zombie shooting games kind of a thing so probably don't wanna sucker people into that but if you want to join me for a scary zombie shooting game after this that's what I'll be doing this evening as usually promised but today as a vlog what I end up doing was reviewing my headphones earbuds and this watch that I kind of hate so that's what you get to look forward to - Marcus is a forewarning slash teaser we'll take a moment here we get I'm gonna get caught up on comments here in a second I think since a lot going on here hold on let me point you in this direction then I have a better chance of reading them without poking the camera lots of people say you hi there's a few hi Laura's there and then somebody saying it it is Amy I don't know if that means hey Mary everybody say we're back that's good space invaders is a old-school video game but the street art was done by a parisian artist yeah but you can find them all over the world it's actually he's been in like 66 different countries so you can go to his website and see what cities he's been in and arnobs66 different cities not 66 different countries as a little bit of an overstatement anyways he's great he's Parisian and so there are a lot of them in Paris there's like 1300 and some of them in Paris whereas you won't find that many in any other city around I'm sure sorry the resolutions low I can't help that that's just the network my bitrate is limited by whatever my cell network is at the moment so hopefully I'll get back to full resolution here soon [Applause] [Music] am I getting caught up to everything all kinds of hey Laura's and alright thanks Johnny appreciate that now that I'm that caught up I guess I might cut up yet hey Maria glad you're gonna be in the neighborhood in June looks like tons of suggestions for restaurants and all kinds of stuff if you want to download my guide I actually have like 240 recommendations and there are more all the time then once the game is up and running there will be some natively within that as well is the plan so I don't have a link to my guide below but it's basically bitly slash Paris vloggers guide and I would have put that on there earlier but I don't want to be standing around all these people are there we go that's a little bit better hey mystery man Thank You DJ poser how's it going [Music] yeah they'll be good looking forward to it your Paul says but there's one gesture we'll go by one that's gonna be up here for a restaurant but I can show you oh thanks for buying the guy Europe it's a lot of fun to create and I think it's well worth it not that I'm biased J I'm totally biased as you can see jardin de luxembourg we'll go take a closer look but it is closed already because they closed them at dusk with like guys who that they walk around whistling at people on loud whistles oh right so the restaurant way it's down there so as Liam fortes just down here with the green awning thanks Emily's town I appreciate it well or your this is for Laura's coffee or drink specifically she appreciates it so then yeah that green awning down there is as I think and that's it's a tasty one fun warm drinks it's an American style diner basically very classy on the inside we'll see more of it again later it's a little of a Natasha favorites zero here is the Jardin de Luxembourg glad you could make it though don't worry about it Paige what's that I have not actually been in Luxembourg Museum nah that's another thing I should do here is the Jardin de Luxembourg wait hold on I bet you can get through the through the slats look at that now we're inside the park you guys are inside the park I'm still outside the park again I'm glad that you had a good time Jim I was here for the World Cup celebrations you can go look at all my videos about it if I actually even did one there's basically a live stream it's like 20 minutes long of just the the revelry in the streets afterwards so if you want to check that out you can always watch that I don't believe there's water on my lens does it look like there's a lot on my lens my preview looks pretty good but if there is I can try to fix that anyways that's a little bit of the shirt Alexa Berg I'm not kidding that you're in there and I'm not I'm on the other side of the bars right now how does it how is it and how's it inside the park are you having a good time I'm stuck outside so let me know okay so I got a rotate this campus back through the bars and there we go now from here we should probably walk back down more towards the river and away from this conversation that is not working out for this woman gotta love it when people are on their phones just shouting hello in public can you hear me I can't hear you where are you why are you ignoring me good we could actually oh wait there's um oh no that place is closed I was gonna say we couldn't we couldn't grab a beer out of the way we get actually ended the lefty moose there you go you got some guys that are really excited to be in it or flipping the camera off in the end started out as peace signs ended up as flipping off that's what you can expect people don't do that when I'm doing it on my hand I think it's the gamble that draws the attention people see the gimbal and it like I know what to do with this guy okay let's let's get a little bit more starting to Luxemburg footage here a little more of a peek as we walk you don't mind the bars in which building oh the Senate they do now good Java that's the Senate that we're looking at there's the National Assembly and then there's the Senate the Senate is here the National Assembly is over on the river and that's where you know the laws are made and the Kings are beheaded just kidding that happens in Congress that's come one it's actually two isn't it it's the weekend no it's the whole weekend yeah so if you want there's an event that I've never participated in that I need to this year called I think it's I don't remember it's the weekend a pet someone but it's basically a time where all the government buildings are open for the weekend and you can go in to any of them it the lines are really long and it's but even the the Ã©lysÃ©e the presidential palace is open on the weekend seem go paid a visit and see what your tax dollars go to or what the frenches tax dollars go to hear what else you got for is Laura you're full of useful information that's fantastic it's very cute run by an American lady who you will all get to meet in the not-too-distant future hopefully should go talk to her I can't go talk to her now though but I'll talk to her again soon okay we got Jean neighs Jean they they patched him on okay there we go thanks appreciate appreciate the research on the fly there that uh I am so far behind in all the comments and stuff but hopefully everything is just great who's number one I hope I'm number one dinner in the Latin Quarter for everyone if you want pizza Lisa there are a couple of pizza places around here that I really wanted to try actually so many good options maybe we should get dinner after this is over cuz then I got to go home and stream to better do that on a full on a full stomach nothing you are obsessed from Robin yeah we gotta try that place no the line will be murdered let's go to wait what about that pizza place that's on really can come in either that's where we can end yeah okay we're just coming up with this plan as we go it's totally do you need a city pass for the kids I mean I think it depends on their age but I don't know what the rules are for kids on what all they need something I should probably look a little more actively into some little kids are led into step for free and but even on the metro I think like dogs have to have like a Demi ticket or something and watching the Oscars is not big in France let's do it sounds obese works great but might as well cross well he got the crossing yeah I'm not I mean I don't think anybody does it I mean people know about the Oscars in there they're into it more or less here I don't know people like stay up and watch it though people have started seeing ups watch the Super Bowl hear more and more although this is a bad year to do that the first year that they like actively broadcasted in France something like that it was like there's something monumental happening and then it happened to be like the worst Super Bowl ever yeah but the thing is when you watch the Super Bowl here you don't get the ads and that's why you watch the Superbowl same thing that like when we were in Africa we would go watch it on on like at the Embassy like in Togo we went to the embassy and wash it at the marine house and they had the Armed Forces version and so instead of commercials you had these terrible like public service announcements which sorry if you're in the military and that's what you're stuck with watching all the time but for us those of us that aren't used to it yeah it was traumatizing I was like where the commercials okay we're following you two cents apiece also just looking to see if I missed I'm missing all kinds of comments you guys I'm really sorry almost everything Dez says almost everything is pretty kids you'll need to get single tickets for each child on the Metro ok well this wasn't leading us straight on that hi Jeremiah Jennifer now the ratings are going way down for the Oscars it's very true you can take dogs in to lots of restaurants you can actually get dogs into a surprising number of places as if you see we're all we get do stuff you will know is we're not quite everywhere most everywhere Laura's Laura's around a lot more now she lives here permanently so that's cool it's a popularity that's the one we were talking about earlier yeah that's in the mama group personally I'm not here end of the mama groups pizza right right they also don't have Jesus I think it's part of the problems but they like they're fine there's I haven't found a place that I'm obsessed with their pizza here yet though I haven't found my my Parisian pizza pipeline is what I'm trying to say oh is this the backside of it let's move this way yeah it's also way less crowded this is nice walking under this archway straight above which I got to hurry up and try it wow that come on camera move faster kind of cool though isn't it like there's it's a old-school walkway earth called sky which is sky bridge skywars something they're everywhere you know where was I Minneapolis it was Minneapolis cuz it's so snowy that the downtown is just crisscross but the sky bridge is just great I think that's an amazing amazing but I thought I'd switch it around so you guys can see it behind me because it's kind of cool and then ahead of us is the backside of a social piece which has a star on top and I never notice that Oh getting the music of the city Michael I will just let you I'll let you go subscribe to Laura's channel where is the trying to get caught up on some of these two Chinese places last year I go to I do like a good Chinese spot but we found we showed you a couple of invaders we haven't found any new ones yet though Laura thought she found anyone but it wasn't anyone we're going to say so peace it's also be salt suit geese st. sulpice hotel how everyone pronounce it Oh enjoy your reading Emily if you're still here and time to see that that ya Desiree's got more kay I'm gonna get more kid input from the peloton guys as well here soon for my guide actually cuz it's a weakness of mine because I don't have kids and don't really plan on including them in my Parisian lifestyle any time soon so you know gotta reach out to other people to help me with that here's the bad this is cool I don't think I've ever come around the backside of social peace before you can see for those of you that are asking about street art you can see over here the remains of a squiddy what I call a squiddy by a guy called geez up it's a terrible name you can't even pronounce it I mean I guess it looks good but and there's a real squiddy behind us here oh yeah there's a what's that character that's that octopus from like the 60s cartoon and there we go and then these are like little Anarchy hearts which I don't know what those are for and I think they're kind of lame and then you can see little paint splotches along the way too you'll see these really bright paint paint splotches as you go I can borrow your kids does how about I just take the information and I will leave the kids with you something about Yanni you guys are talking Johnny and polish time about a bikes oh yeah you got a you got a hot animators while you're here Tim they're great oh and we can see some very French lighting over there is that the Mary of the 6th or what is that we're about to find out I should know that did David okay David Lebovitz is one of those guys that I didn't really know about till recently somebody talked about their reading one of his books right now and he was on the earful to our reasonably you know him you know he is okay I'm glad that makes me feel a little bit better he's one of those ones it's a really popular Parisian he's he's not Parisian but he's a very popular Paris writer and yeah everybody loves him and I really didn't know anything about him till recently this whose tank this guy's see you turn around fast enough no I gotta get out of the street I'm trying to pay that guy running with his carry-on luggage but didn't work look at these streets

about that thought with its lions before I gave up again I'll get back to it I'm sure here's the front of sync so peace social peace if you're interested I always thought that this one looks it's very simple I always thought that and really trusting connection to keep you going we'll see what happens when we walk down the street here hopefully we keep going it is this Peter says it is the church from The Da Vinci Code I don't know if they heard you say that or not because we were dropping a lot you all right we're back are we really back hopefully I'm sorry those of you that are bailing because the connection states we're about to finish up yeah it's frustrating for me too technology not working the way it's supposed to is one of my great frustrations in life oh the LIA one do I have
