 hello and welcome to Sicily I am right now in Artesia which is a small part of siracusa Sicily it is a beautiful beautiful place but I'm not here to talk about Sicily today today I'm here to tell you about Rome because I just spent one week in Rome and I see that a fair exchange budget and I want to share with you the best way is to go to Rome for a vacation on an extreme budget I'm telling you this is like the best way to visit Rome because I spent very little money and I had a fantastic time [Music] the first thing about going to Rome on a budget is of course transportation the first thing you want to think about is your flight yes you do need to worry about how much it costs to get from wherever you are to Rome now I was extremely lucky I booked a flight from Newark New Jersey to Rome for a hundred and forty dollars u.s. dollars yes but I did that because I booked on Cyber Monday which is not common but there are also other ways to get very cheap prices I use Gus cheap flights which is an email subscription for free they send you the best flights you're looking for and you can tell them which Airport you want to leave from they'll tell you where you can go for super cheap that week or that month or that year so keep that in mind but also I use kayak I use my mondo sky scanner and Google flights my two main ones are sky scanner and Google flights I use them interchangeably they both have their their best uses Google Places great to find the ship location sky scanner is great to find a cheap time to travel in so keep those both in mind and use them both when you're trying to book a cheap flight okay you're in Rome you got your flight great fantastic I'm so happy for you but you need to get from the airport to Rome it's actually about an hour obey the Fiumicino Airport is not the airport that's closest to Rome there's also another Airport but it's small and it's local and they don't use that for most international flights so you're gonna be coming from Fiumicino Airport now you need to go from there to the center of Rome and you don't want to take a tack you're an uber that is by far the most expensive way to get from the airport to Rome you're gonna look into trains they have a great express train for only fourteen to fifteen euros but you can go even cheaper you can take a bus for five or six euros you can take a bus from the airport to the center of Rome so do that find the bus when you come out of the airport go to the right after you pick up your bags or if you don't have any bags just come out go to the right and then keep walking and your get to the bus's area and they have ticket stands you're gonna buy your ticket and it's going to be five or six euros and you're gonna save yourself a whole bunch of cash transportation around from they don't have big roads and some things are far away from each other so you're gonna want to figure this out you can take taxis don't take taxis never take taxis number one road budget traveling is don't take taxis so don't do it you can take the bus where you take the metro in fact I recommend taking neither of those and walking yes you can burn off all that posture you're gonna be eating by walking now it sounds daunting in a zone so annoying you're gonna smell time consuming and painful but trust me when you don't have to pay for euros to go one way or another way across the city and you can just walk it's going to be much more liberating then you think I like walking through moving on now we're talking about a combination a combination is very important because your combination costs are your second biggest cost next to your transportation and you're gonna want to think this through can you hear me that's my host I'm losing light basically so now I'm doing YouTube video a United States all right so as you see the Sun is down the lighting is not good enough there is just this just couple walking by and they ask me where I'm from so then we continue to talk for 20 more minutes about Sicily in America and Europe and food and people and culture and it was wonderful so if you just talked and chatted for a while so gonna look different from here on out in the video your ain't Rome and you want to eat everything in sight and you know that that's not something you can push it on because you're not gonna be in Rome every day and you cannot have the pizza of Rome and the pasta of Rome without spending money for it right but here's a trick so go to a grocery store buy your practice in your dinner and make those you're staying at an Airbnb should have a kitchen if you staying in a hostel you definitely have a kitchen so use those go to the grocery store and buy stuff for your breakfast buy stuff for your dinner and cook them yourself okay that's gonna save you two meals a day this should at least twenty bucks so that's for $7.99 I have breakfast for four days probably dinner for four days because if I eat one meal out for the rest of the days then I can have two meals in for only $2.00 thing perfect so if you do that then you can eat your lunch out why it's better to eat lunch then dinner it's usually lunch is cheaper but you can still get some of the really good stuff you can still get the pasta the whatever expensive Italian meal you're looking for you can get that for lunch as well and then be a little bit cheaper so I recommend lunch being your meal out and only have one meal out a day because if you buy all three meals out every day you are going to blow through your budget faster than fast but if you make her own breakfast and you make your own dinner you can still have your cappuccino you can still have some tiramisu some gelato but make sure that you are providing those two meals for yourself and that'll save you a bunch of money right off the bat now when you do go out for a meal um try not to get the four-course meals those are gonna add up so fast what I did was I got an antipasto appetizer and it was so good I got this fresh cheese and then like four different kind of nice then olives and it was it was so good it was so Italian and it was absolutely delicious and it was so much cheaper than everything else on the menu but I got a lot of food and it was really delicious so choose an appetizer instead of a dinner meal most Emily no um gelato it's cheaper than a Chitauri to get in a restaurant so if you go out to a gelateria and you just go in I mean they have them everywhere on every corner they just have all the chelator in the window you can get three scoops of gelato for like two years so do that instead of ordering tiramisu or something fancy and special in the restaurant because it'll be at least two times more expensive to order do their in the restaurant then if you order it walking by if you don't like gelato or you want something more then they have a lot of little bakeries that you can just walk by and you can just get a little cup of tiramisu or you can get a little cannoli or whatever you're looking for my biggest point is don't buy it in the restaurant go somewhere else after you eat and get it from a place where you can get it to go or where you can buy just a little bit at a time a combination is gonna be a big chunkier money and I highly recommend hostels even air B&B is can be cheap as well so look at those but hostels you can get a good 10 euro a night hostel and they will have a kitchen and a frigerator that you can use for that you can make your brochure you like I said before so look in the hostel that's the cheapest way to get your accommodation in Rome this is a big one and this isn't about attractions within Rome you want to see all the museums you want to see all the sights you want to count the rooms and that's gonna get really expensive my the biggest suggestion you're gonna find when you google how to do Rome on a budget is a link to the discount pass the Roma pass where you pay 30 or 40 euros for two or three days and you get discounts all the museums and you get one or two museums or attractions free but you have to pay if that big sum up front I think you can do it for even cheaper than 30 40 euros skip the Roma pass altogether because you're not gonna be using the metro you're gonna be walking or if you're gonna be using the Metro a lot get an all-day pass and save yourself some dollars there but you don't need the Roma hat so pass on the past and instead if you go on a Sunday a lot of the museums are gonna be free you can go to the museums for free on the Sunday so just make sure that while you're there there's a Sunday happening and then use that day to go and get your museums out of the rain also a lot of attractions are free the color field it is just absolutely beautiful from the outside you can go inside if you want to but that's an extra 13 to 15 euros so don't what I recommend is downloading the Rick Steves audio guide app now the Rick Steves audio guide app for Europe they have so many like detailed descriptions of different places you can go they have one for the Colosseum the Pantheon the Roman Forum and these are all 32 like 45 minute audio guides and you can literally like walk through the town listening to this and all say and then when you walk up to this corner you will see this church and this church is here because and this is cool about it because and it just saves you so much money in Tour fees and getting a private tour do not buy yourself a private tour that is just such a that ism of wallet emptying steam to take all your money away so don't buy a private tour and even walking tours the free walking tours you still have to pay like 10 euros for a tip and sometimes you have to pay a booking fee online so just be careful with the free walking tours I do recommend those absolutely more than private tours but um if you just walk around the city with Rick Steves audio guide and your headphones then you've got all taken care of and I personally found a lot more information and I found a lot more interesting to use the Rick Steves audio guide app instead of what the tour guide told me my favorite attraction in Rome was going up Giancola Hill Giancola Hill is interesting which is across the river from the main area in Rome and there's this hill and you can go all the way up it's not even that big of a walk but you go up and you can just the skyline in Rome you see over the whole city and it's so beautiful I was there right when the Sun was going down and it was absolutely perfect and the streets are well lit enough that you can walk back down on the dark so don't worry about that but it was completely free so my favorite times in Rome was just walking around bright didn't need a paint ticket to anything and just going in for free similary know the Vatican you can go into the Vatican without paying any money welcome for the Vatican medium that's different and people try to tell you to skip the lines buy a ticket but the line wasn't that bad it actually goes pretty quickly so like there's so much stuff you can do for free don't pay to go to any of the attractions you just don't need to what I like to do is pretend that anything that cost money I just can't go into like they're doing a construction on it I'm not allowed to go I just I consider myself not having permission to enter the area if it costs me money to go in and you know what I'm perfectly satisfied seeing all of the free things there are there are so many free incredible amazing things to see in Rome you do not need a ticket to court you don't that's the whole video for you guys today I hope you enjoy your time in the world see if we have a comment let me know if you go how you liked it anything you have to add to this please do
