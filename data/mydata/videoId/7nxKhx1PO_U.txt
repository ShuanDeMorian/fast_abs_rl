 today's vlog day 944 good morning it's a beautiful Friday here in Paris and I thought that today would be a good opportunity for me to make a short video explaining a little bit about my guide to Paris I wrote a guide to Paris it's a PDF you can download it it's formatted for your phone so you can carry it around and find all sorts of delicious things around the city while you're wandering the city but it's not just full of delicious things it's also full of some scary things anyways I figured that I'd explain that for you today in all honesty just so that I can link this to people later who asked about the guide and then they can get everything they need to know about it and of course I think we should start with coffee that's all I want right now so for 20 bucks you get stock the range of two hundred and forty recommendations including a lot yes in case you're unaware finding good coffee in Paris this was really hard to do as a pro pro used to be hard to cheesier I've lots of great spots you can go for that not just coffee things like parks there are tons of great parks in the city some of which you know of already some of which may be harder to find but included in like the photo locations and places to visit are a number of great parks like this one right here the thing is the cornerstone of the guide for me is actually sharing places that I know and love in the city it's really easy to find food in Paris there's a lot of great food lots of great bars lots of great whatever but what I'm sharing are the places you've seen on the vlog places I know I love in places that I know are gonna give you a great experience not only are they quality like good quality coffee good wine good whatever but they're sitting around knowing for sure that you're gonna have a good experiences with the places you go and I only want to recommend places that you're gonna have a good time at whether or not they're easy to find and a lot of them are out of the way because come on let's explore Paris really it's also a collection of short essays on where I think you should stay where I think you should not stay how to avoid certain scams in the city how to get around the city among a number of different things like that it's I mean the thing is loaded it's I have to look that up and up with actual number on the screen but it's pretty long [Music] you gotta have some of must-see locations as well but not only do I treat these as photo spots but you'll get tips and tricks that all come from a local a little bit about skipping lines a little bit about better angles places to go where there are fewer tourists so you can get a photo that you prefer I try to include it all in there tons of the information obviously is available through my blog already and of course I mean tons of restaurant recommendations I'm not gonna say that there are no restaurant there's lots of good restaurants I mean you try to hook you up with some nice spots like this for photos along the way but that makes sense it's a very dense collection of recommendations and information that I've you know put together of a long time scams that are handy to know before you get here so that when you see them in action you don't fall for them either just bundles of other stuff it's a PDF guide downloadable please please please make sure you actually download it and save it don't just open it on your phone I would save it to your desktop and then move it to your phone after that because if you open it and you don't download it you only get three times of downloading it and they're very different things so just throwing that out there as well and if this is the first time you've ever seen any of my videos hopefully you'll watch my vlog for those either watch my vlog every day that a fantastic day today that up with Richard for coffee hung out with Gustav which is always a pleasure when for a really long walk obviously I've been all over the city discovered a couple of new places which are on my map stream for those of you who want kind of the interactive version of all of this you always become a patron at the $10 an uplevel and all of those patrons gave access to my master it's a great way to bounce around the city and is a collection of a lot of these things but on a live map so that can help you find out where you are and you know figure out if there's anything nearby at the time also because it's gonna get linked a bunch I'm getting very close to launching the game I'll be sure to put links to the game below as well if you haven't heard of that yet or be interested in playing it as soon as I've got information available I'll put that below but anyway so it's not I make a short video today if you want to watch more tons of videos about Paris I'll link to my french Friday playlist below but you can find all kinds of information and just daily life I've vlog every different person yeah it's a great way to see the city through the eyes of somebody who lives here and you know enjoys his time as much as he can while he is here so with that we're gonna wrap this up and I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for you have more of those daily vlogs and hopefully a lot more fun stuff to come [Music]
