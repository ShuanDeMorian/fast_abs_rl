		"description": "I spent 5 days in Rome and only spend $159.84. I even splurged a bit. \n\nTransportation 0:58 \nFood 5:44\nAccommodation 9:03\nAttractions 9:33\n\nHere's the breakdown of how I traveled Rome on a budget:\nACCOMMODATION: \nHostel bed: $51.25\nCity Tax: $18.00\nTotal: $69.25\n\nFOOD:\nRavioli dinner with Tiramisu: $17.17 \nFancy antipasta with Cappucino: $22.13\nGelato: $3.09\nGroceries (yogurt, apples, pasta, sauce, wine): $9.90\nTotal: $52.29\n\nATTRACTIONS:\nWalking Tour: $15.38\nTotal: $15.38\n\nTRANSPORTATION:\nBus: $7.43\nBus: $7.43\nMetro: $8.06\nTotal: $22.92\n\nALL TOGETHER: $159.84.\n\nFor five days in Rome, I spent under $160. This is fantastic, considering Rome is an expensive city in an expensive country! But if you're wondering how to travel Rome on a budget, or looking for some budget travel tips, you've come to the right place. \n\nThe best tips are included in the video, but for those who just want to read and continue on preparing for your trip, remember these key points:\n1. If you want to keep to your Rome trip budget, walk as much as possible.\n2. If you want to eat on a budget in Rome, buy groceries and cook (some) meals.\n3. If you need cheap accommodation in Rome, stay in a hostel or AirBnB.\n4. If you're looking for free things to do in Rome, visit the many free attractions (the Vatican, Giancolo Hill, The Colosseum (outside), the parks, Trastevere, the river, etc.)\n\nThis last one is a big one. It is easy to throw money at private tours or special tours. Some of those tours might be amazing. But you're at a point in your life where you can't afford the pricey amazing, just the budget amazing. Thankfully, there are a lot of free things to do in Rome, so the budget amazing is actually worth your time.\n\nMORE QUESTIONS?! I'm happy to hear that.

So many of the sites are free, best see those first before even considering spending your hard earned on the paying attractions. I&#39;m spending four days in Rome to get my bearings then probably heading south (who knows) I think to Naples, Pompeii etc. I did Milan and Florence last November and enjoyed it so much it made me want to come again. Do you recommended any other destinations to visit from/after Rome, I&#39;m in Italy for two weeks just travelling around?",

Yes the cheapest way from the airport to the center of Rome is definitely by bus, a return trip will cost only \u20ac9 . Always eat at a local Italian restaurant, good tasty food at a reasonable price. Also fill up a water bottle from any one of Rome\u2019s many water fountains, it\u2019s safe to drink and it\u2019s free..Also walking around is also free. I use <a href=\"http://agoda.com/\">Agoda.com</a> to book my Hotel, and I normally pay \u20ac50 per night for a 4 star Hotel,single room with bathroom, free WiFi and breakfast. Breakfast is great because you can make a huge sandwich, yogurt,fruit and take them out with you, basically a free lunch.
