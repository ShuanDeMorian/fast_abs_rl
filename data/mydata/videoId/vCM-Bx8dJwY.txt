 today is vlog day 909 good morning it's a very gray and rainy day out there it looks like in other words winter is here and I'm headed down to the Marais I'm gonna go meet with Paul and Christian who are the owners of bike about and the peloton we're gonna talk a little bit about this next coming season and all my schemes that go with it do mind watch do not charge last night so looking forward to we're gonna try and do some fun new things and let's do it pans out we're also gonna be going to we work they used to have an accountant we work I don't think they do anymore but we're gonna go meet there I still kind of Harbor this like mild dream of having my own we work account Sunday so I have my own like space to go and work no matter what time of the day it is and nobody's gonna kick me out because it's lunchtime and but that is another story I need to go or I'm gonna be late I'm I'm running I'm running close I'm not cutting it super close but you know I don't wanna be too late I also hope that it because it's we work they'll have coffee available because that's one of the reasons I want account there anyways it's just for the unlimited coffee cuz who wouldn't want that then I shut my finger in a drawer there's the bloody been waiting for Dave been a while anyways now I'm definitely late [Music] since the coffee so I grabbed a bike you wrote here and now the whole front of me is completely soaked anywho miss drama maybe grab a coffee maybe a brownie except had neither and then get to work [Music] gotta make it without spilling my coffee [Music] love those guys great meeting as always that's good ideas floating around getting very excited for the game now it's just a matter of actually making everything work I also got a brownie head strata very rich had like a caramel and almond slice icing on top I'm not really sure what was going on really good couldn't finish it but I needed like real food now I don't know I'm doing myself we'll figure this out [Music] the trip right now is what to do for lunch a lot of more work I want to do and another meeting this evening that I'm looking forward to still gonna have much of an appetite Velasquez I don't know why brownie was probably enough calories for a month or two I really am enjoying these gray days give us something to hide from what you've got somewhere cozy to go that is one of the best parts [Music] [Music] fast whoa fast forwards of my windows one in the fall parking and I'm pretty I'm getting I'm getting there's progress that's been made I don't know if you remember these stickers but these are going to be coming into effect here soon it has been available at the peloton and I just never really advertised it I never told people about it we're gonna do something more fun with them ivory collected these from Kate I'm gonna get a bunch more from the guys the public sign I forgot to ask them to bring those this morning but I'll go down and get those at some point but it's all gonna factor in everything's gonna make sense eventually in the meantime it's a really great aura fiying the miserable day outside and I think that means it's perfect to go for a run freeze myself a little bit before I go meet Val for we're supposed to mean last night I Caroline had a friend who had an emergency and so I had to cancel oh man it was postponed until tonight and I'll see now I'll to talk a little bit about more plotting with her there should be really good I want my favorite little tap houses that we were gonna go to last night and didn't end up going to you so I'm trying to share that with you here shortly and that should be pretty glamorous I just skipped the whole lunch finding thing I just grabbed a sandwich on my way home it was a good cheap option and you know it's just cold feeling a little better than I was yesterday which is really good just I just needed another good night's sleep and a little bit of space and I knew that I'd be up and running and a side note for those of you who are big Facebook fans and users you may have already picked up on the fact that I am NOT and I just hope in Facebook for the first time like my facebook page in like two months and sorry for those of you who had messages sitting in there just waiting I really don't use Facebook I did have it set up to automatically post my Instagram photos to my Facebook page just so there was something going on there but I just for a lot of reasons that I could get into at some point I really just don't like Facebook I don't as a website and an app both I find it very clunky and just unfund it's not fun to use I don't enjoy being on Facebook not to mention just how yeah it's a whole other conversation that in mind if you'd like to interact with me maybe follow me on Twitter or on Instagram instead even though Instagram is now owned by Facebook hopefully if Instagram will remain fun to use for at least a little while longer and of course you can always leave comments below here there's a lot of fun ways to interact with me that don't necessarily involve Facebook I will try to log into Facebook every once in a while still because I still have a Facebook page and it's still there but you know if you want to interact with me the comments section below is a great way to do it and of course there's always like I said Twitter and Instagram and patreon and I mean I don't really post anything on Reddit so I wouldn't necessarily try to interact with me on reddit that's just I don't know it's reddit reddit is its own thing anywho all that said and done and before I lose my motivation I was feeling the juice to go run I'm feeling that juice fading let's just let's go run before we [Music] I ran a little bit farther than usual not too much further I thought about doing a longer run now that I'm inside I wish I would have gone farther actually click on like for a 10k pretty easily there I just pushed a little bit farther it's good though it's a good sign I'm enjoying this like the consistency in the running is is kind of like its own natural motivation like yesterday I felt the itch like I really wanted to go for a run yesterday I was just making myself rest also kind of in a bad mood and probably what helps a little bit to have done it but my legs needed a break from you know all of the wheeling and running soon though wheeling won't cause me any problems and I'll be ready to do both all the time whenever I feel like it but overall a good run it's nice to go out and run in a little bit of rain I actually don't mind it that much it's good to get out a little bit further into tell me I only really want to run in town when it's dark generally anyway it's like usually there in other parts of the year running when it's dark means that it's also a lot less traffic right now traffic is definitely out there but the nice thing is the days are getting a little bit longer so you go a little bit more Twilight it's very nice I definitely enjoy a good run through Paris there's nothing to complain about there I'm gonna shower eat something and then I gotta go meet Val I'll show you lot B news it's just one of my favourite little tap houses and I think it's in the night and I just remember which neighborhood it's in technically it's kind of it's but I'll share that with you it's on my map stir it's one of the places I absolutely love even though I don't go there very often wanted to ask them a couple questions tonight as well about the game and then I'll probably stop teasing you about the game today because I realize it's been a pretty tease heavy video it's gonna get better soon don't worry the answers are coming there they're definitely coming I feel really hot and sweaty and I want to take all of this off and just stand in front of a fan for a minute so I will see you after I shower [Music] unfortunately there are no tables left which is really free for like five minutes so she had got a cider so we're gonna go to another place or they could be but I love this spot you have to get here early to get you know a table but [Music] yeah long awaited success [Music]
