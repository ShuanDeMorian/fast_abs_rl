But not too badly - I tend to be careful when I do.\n\nWhy are you living in #Paris? - Because I've always wanted to; I feel at home here: https://youtu.be/4Vivf6MqMxQ\n\nDo you speak French? Oui. https://youtu.be/va1QjaHgij8\n\nYou talk a lot about the books you're working on, what are they about? - They're sci-fi (and fantasy) and I've got a decent pitch for you here: https://youtu.be/W2bKt4_Tp4E\n\nDo you make money off YouTube? - Ha, no. I wish. It took me over 500 videos to make my first total $100 off adsense. I think it will slowly change, but VERY slowly.\n\nI really enjoy your videos, how can I support you? - The easiest and best way to support me is through Patreon, where you can pitch in as little as $1/mo to help me make better videos: http://patreon.com/jayswanson\n\nI don't trust this Patreon thing - can I just paypal you? - Here's my ko-fi if that's your thing (and coffee is your game): https://ko-fi.com/jayswanson\n\nBut I want to send you something tangible! - I do have a wishlist on Amazon, though it's a bit complicated with the international shipping situation.

I think it&#39;s one of the most exciting recent buildings in the world, designed by Frank Gehry, of course. Perhaps you should devote an entire vlog to the Bois de Bouologne; many people never see it because they think it&#39;s too far away. You could talk about Roland Garros and the waterfall next to the spectacular Grand Cascade resto. There is a navette at metro stop Etoile that for one euro will take you straight to the LV Fondacion. I saw the inaugural exhibition a couple of years ago and then went again last month when I was in Paris for my birthday. I am loving this series; I feel like a short trip to Paris every morning. I do think better of the Palais de Tokyo than you do, however. ;-) Thanks so much for all your energy and stamina. BTW, that photo is from my AirBnB apartment on Place Blanche with the Moulin Rouge in the background. What a locale!",
