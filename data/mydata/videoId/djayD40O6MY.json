Millions of tourists visit every year, but make no mistake, Rome is not a city overrun by tourism, step away from the siteseeing bus route, and discover a modern capital, with some of the best food, shopping, and nightlife we\u2019ve found yet.\n\nRome is served by two international airports, and of course this is where out guide starts.\n\nFiumicino airport sits to the west of the City, and Ciampino to the south east. Transfers from each are relatively easy, first up Fiumicino.\n\nFrom Fiumicino you have the Leonardo Express to Rome Termini, and the regional FL1 train to other stations across Rome. \nWe don\u2019t recommend the bus as it\u2019s much slower than the train, and can be severely delayed in Rome\u2019s notoriously bad traffic. \n\nOur tip here is to make sure you get your ticket validated before you get on the train, otherwise you could find yourself facing a hefty fine!\n\nWhen catching a taxi look out for those registered in the airport region, as they will take you anywhere within the city walls for a fixed fee.You can spot them by the crest on the doors.\n\nIf you\u2019re flying into Ciampino airport we recommend using the bus to get into Rome. There is a train station nearby but it\u2019s a bit of a pain and requires lots of different connections. Taxis should offer a flat fare of \u20ac30 to take you anywhere inside the city walls. But do be careful, we\u2019ve heard of tourists being ripped off.\n\nPublic transport in Rome isn\u2019t as prrevelend as in other major European capitals. The tram doesn\u2019t run through the major tourist areas and the metro doesn\u2019t cover nearly as much of the city as its London and Paris counterparts. That said, the Metro can get you into town quickly from your hotel so it\u2019s worth understanding.\n\nThe metro has just three lines; A and B intersect at Rome Termini station and C is the newest line that runs from the centre to the east of the city.\n\nThe metro isn\u2019t the cleanest in the world, but it does the job just fine in our experience. Of course good old Google Maps, and Citymapper were all we needed for navigation with both apps finding the quickest and most efficient routes with ease.\n\nAs for tickets, there are two main types of tickets to use on public transport in Rome. The Metrebus ticket or the Roma Pass.\n\nMetrebus tickets can be used on all public trains, buses and trams and can be purchased at bars, tobacconists, train stations, some bus stops and even hotels. Tickets aren\u2019t validated until you travel, so you can easily stock up on all the tickets you\u2019ll need for your time in Rome in one go.\n\nMetre\u2019s tickets come in several different variations, and here\u2019s the lowdown:\nThe BIT is the single ticket for one complete Metro journey, one commuter-train ride, or 100 minutes on the bus.\nRoma 24H is valid for 24 hours after the first use and costs \u20ac7 for unlimited travel. The 48H is \u20ac12.50And the 72H is \u20ac18And the CIS is a 7-day ticket and will set you back \u20ac24.\nComing in 48-hour and 72-hour variations, The Roma Pass gives unlimited travel on public transport but includes discounts on some tourist attractions.
