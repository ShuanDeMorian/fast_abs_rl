 slightly 1009 that's 9 more than a thousand I can do math good morning and welcome to day nine of my 20 and 20 what you might be asking is a 20 and 20 well basically there are 20 around these months in Paris 20 districts to Paris and I'm spending a day in each making a video in each highlighting some spots that I would normally recommend that are in my guide or on my map stir if you happen to be one of my patrons at $10 and up you get access to my master which I update all the time yes might as well cross through here my master also has some random stuff in London in other places but we're focused obviously on Paris and today we are in the 9th around East Mountain currently on the border between the 9th and the 18th if that makes no sense to you whatsoever check out this handy map right here should have make things you know a little bit clearer the way that the around these months work is that they start in the center and spiral all the way out to the bigger ones on the outside in sequential order now one of the differences is that I haven't really gotten into and I've been meaning to this whole time but keep forgiving you talk about is that neighborhoods and districts are different so if you have a neighborhood neighborhoods are named and districts are numbered on these malls being the districts so the all these months are actual municipal districts that have their own mayors that have a variety of different responsibilities and rights where neighborhoods are more of cultural boundaries so when we talk about snatch Armande pick or the Marais or Big Al which is where I'm at right now those are more neighborhoods that are defined by culture and style more than municipality but speaking of style it's something to go get some OG coffee from one of the older coffee shops in town and one of the better ones KB coffee I do love KB and especially once their patios open fantastic spot just to sit so nice and the coffee is so good okay I'm gonna head back up to the border of the 9th here because it is kind of interesting the top of the 9th is famous for its nightlife as much as it's good food it includes half of the gaol half of launched half a plastic lychee or maybe you only have heard of plastique Ishii not really sure how much best to Clichy it's got the gaol is of course the famous old-school sex shop district back in the day when the gi's showed up here in World War 2 they called it pig alley because it was you know the smutty part of town and just past it is where you'll find Moulin Rouge but Moulin Rouge is in the 18th so we will be pretending we don't see it today and of course plus key she also has is famous for its nightlife there's a lot going on there as well but I pick out there's a lot of great stuff at the gala like some of my favorite bars are over here one of my favorite taco places is over there there are number of things around Big Al that are actually a lot of fun and tasty delicious I have a bunch of places that I recommended my guide up here for pizza burgers French food tacos coffee everything so while Big Al is probably most famous for its sex shops and all that nonsense it's probably should be best known for its food it's a really nice area overall just get a little bit south of all the neon lights you'll find a good Mueller too importantly there is a space invader on the statue at the center of plasticky chief we're looking for them it's trying to share this with Laura and Paul earlier and they they didn't know where it was so there you go this area is definitely known for its it's nightlife lots of students end up living in around here we'll talk about the 17th some other time it's on the other side of the square right now we're gonna shoot straight down there are two churches that I want to see today but I'm kind of worried about the churches and well as everything else today because it is Easter Sunday happy Easter to those of you who are celebrating that today there's a lot that's gonna be closed happily KB was open unfortunately the French restaurant I wanted to go to today not open there is another spot that I'm hoping is open that I really love as well that actually I would prefer to eat at today anyways we're gonna try to go to two churches and two very ritzy places and then we'll see what comes of it normally that would have been a much more dramatic reveal but uh Trinity is currently under a severe amount of scaffolding which is unfortunate because it's a really beautiful Tower the church itself is really nice but the tower is pretty unique it's really pretty and currently you can I mean it's really unique now to being completely buried in scaffolding that's you know nothing special but definitely unique I've had a few picnics in front of this church this park is actually very nice let's try to get inside see what happens if you want to go inside you have to come up to the side and you'll see a big sign on the wooden you know sudo scaffolding that says entrance [Applause] [Music] a long time since I've been in there I remember the cornerstones at the top of the ceiling those I really remember from before they're really nice very different I think they're beautiful okay we're gonna hit one more Church up ideally another one that I haven't been to in a long time but first we have to go to two churches of different types one dedicated to music and have another one dedicated to consumerism I do have a video about visiting the opera garnier if you'd like to see that I will link to it of course I'm gonna be able to go into it today unfortunately but it's well worth it I also have a video about loser on the city that highlight either gather in Lafayette or pontil I'm not sure gathering Lafayette a little bit out of my price range can't really afford it but it is famous the best part about it honestly is that there's a free view at the top if you go inside and go all you got all the way to the roof there's a fantastic view from the top and then of course the Opera just worth it on its own it looks like they might be doing tours this morning so that's nice if you want to go into the Opera for like at or whatever basically not the gift shop to give shops on the right hand side but going in to get like a tour buy tickets you go in the left hand side if you're facing the front of the Opera House fantastic fantastic building gorgeous honestly if you don't have time to make it out to Versailles while you're in Paris get into the Opera even better it's so beautiful it's so I just outrageously ostentatious and gorgeous and it's a fantastic Versailles substitute and I put it off for a long time before I ever went in the first time that was a mistake highly recommend you go in there too too sweet as the French would say okay gather you Lafayette and print op are right behind it that fancy gold domes are on pin top which means spring in French they're both department stores both incredibly expensive both have rooftops that you can hang out on grab a drink and watch the city go by it's wonderful neither of them are open yet though I think a little bit too early how early am I yeah too early to go up and I honestly I don't think they'll let me I don't know if they'd let me bring my wheel all the way to the roof or not so let's go see another church there's an active ceremony going on in here this morning and notes for them that I've let I don't think I've ever been inside this church we have to come back and check it out another time don't really want to interrupt the services it's going but it sounds nice from the outside we'll go back and check it out some other time here soon abnormal mop is a really nice little area in your caddy new around Ruka day right now which is kind of I don't it's not technically a pedestrian zone but it basically is a pedestrian zone lots of markets some tasty food some pizza some butchers some everything here pretty much everything you need you can take a stroll down here and you'd find it I'm sure there's a pizza place on here that's on my map stir and it's just kind of a fun spot to go for a stroll there's one other thing that I want to find over here there are a couple of covered passageways near here that may or may not be open we'll find out here in a minute [Music] everything is closed in here right now but thankfully it's open so pass house Jeff Loy is right across from me and this is passage Valdo behind me passes really in front of me nothing's open in them right now but thankfully they're open I kind of thought that they would be closed today there are lots of covered passageways down in the second and here in the night didn't want you to miss out entirely have fun finding them and then discovering what's inside them there you have it we've bounced around a lot of the night there is so much to discover in this neighborhood so much good food markets passageways space invaders all over the place probably see one behind me here in a second or two fantastic neighborhood it's actually where I'm right out right now in San Josh or st. George is one of the most expensive parts of the city to live because it's freaking amazing everybody wants to be here right now of course no good Easter Sunday would be complete without a delicious lunch and a wonderful square at my favorite Indian place in Alta in the entire town Kasturi which is of course in my guide on my mobster and just generally delicious it's less pink than it used to be though that's the only downside aside from that ready to eat [Music] so good so full it's been a great day in the night I hope you've enjoyed it as well tomorrow it's gonna be brutal because it's gonna be you know Easter Monday so we'll see what I was open tomorrow but I'm still gonna bounce around just to be great the weather will be fantastic hopefully and I will see you bright and early tomorrow morning for that the last day of my 2020 no not the last day for the 10th day of my 2020 cream Paris see for that [Music]
