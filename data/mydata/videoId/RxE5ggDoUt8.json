Oui. https://youtu.be/va1QjaHgij8\n\nYou talk a lot about the books you're working on, what are they about? - They're sci-fi (and fantasy) and I've got a decent pitch for you here: https://youtu.be/W2bKt4_Tp4E\n\nDo you make money off YouTube? - Ha, no.

Major cities here in the states have been getting scooter companies &quot;dropping them in the city at night&quot; (sometimes multiple competing companies will drop scooters in the same cities the SAME night!) and it is &quot;wreaking havoc&quot; with many people not so happy about it...  but who cares I am still in Paris mode and your video!  TGIF YIPPEE, the weekend starts here.  That helmet was COOL (wow a folding helmet!).  Besides your own books Jay, what is your most favorite book of all time?  Mine is &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; by Kenneth Roberts.  I ask because I am hoping people who comment will tell everyone their favorite all time book, so I can read them too.

It&#39;s about his growing up on a farm on the Argentina pampas. In later life he lived in England and mooched about the Berkshire and Wiltshire Downs and wrote about nature. I really enjoyed reading his description of the festivities at Stonehenge  on midsummer day in 1907 showing that partying at the stones has got a long heritage!",

Normally, if there is a one-way street those have a counter-flow possible for bikes. Amsterdam is littered with them. It is a painted white line. What that tells the motorists to stay behind the bike already on the other side of road to protect the counter-flow lane.<br />In Rotterdam there are few wider roads where there one-way roads equipped with genuine bikepaths on both sides ranging in width from 45cm to 60cm. Since the width of the car lane is at least 3m when there is no heavy traffic ie anything transporting goods, those once bidirectional make nice parking lanes. Those were redesigned not too long, the parking lane was widened by 15cm, bikepaths stayed the same, car lane width decreasing to 2.7m. The reason for it was to reduce the average speed (measured over time ie actual average speed) from 23km to 20km. Little things like that do matter in inner cities. Those not living in the Netherlands wouldn&#39;t understand stuff like that but it is exactly that attention to detail which makes cycling here somewhat pleasant. Ah well. \ud83d\ude09",
