 oh hey it's vlogging a 684 good morning and welcome to another French Friday we're and I'm actually gonna be answering the question whether or not no true DOM is worth it definitely a subjective answer to that but I think it's very worth it I'm gonna spend my time kind of going around the church in it through it tell you a couple fun facts about it try to keep it short but also enjoy some of the views put a little music to it and give you some fun facts and tips one big tip is make sure to come to the garden behind the church that's where I'm starting today this is an area that a lot of people don't make it to for some reason and it's gorgeous lots of flowers beautiful view of the church the church is unbelievable from the backside you can see all of the flying buttresses in their glory although we have some scaffolding today this gives you a completely different angle the most people use - most people are used to the postcard front and not so much the back but the back highly highly worth it so make sure you come and check it out and if you're lucky you'll get some really nice flowers as well I peas these are for my mom these flower shots are from my mom's specifically [Music] the church itself took somewhere between a hundred and twenty and a hundred and like one hundred and eighty years to build I was looking up different timelines I've been it kind of depends on when you consider the beginning of construction in the end of construction officially not an expert sure somebody below can leave you an answer and Wikipedia has you know an answer that was different than I was expecting that's why I'm feeling a little bit less certain about it right now but can you imagine being the person who designed this thing and knowing you're gonna die along before you ever see it completed pretty crazy it's also interesting because so many different architects four or five different architects oversaw the construction of this church which means that the styles as you get higher especially the towers in the front differ and one of the fun things that I like to do and I don't think a lot of people notice is sit in front of the church and actually pay attention to the differences in styling from one tower to the other because they're not symmetrical they look like they're symmetrical at first glance they're not symmetrical [Music] [Applause] the Rose windows are incredible they're the giant circular windows filled with stained glass and they actually removed all the stained glass during World War two to prevent it from getting bombed out basically they were well not to prevented from getting bombed out but if it got bombed out that way they wouldn't at least lose the glass which obviously would cause some serious problems maybe hit it all in the catacombs wandering into speculation now but I'm pretty sure they hid all the glass in the catacombs and then put it all back in after the world was over which is pretty incredible so it's all the original glass and there's actually a stained glass museum you can see here in town which gives you a good idea of like the ways that they used to make and maintain all the stained glass in the city couple things about entering notre Domon you've never been here before maybe an intimidating-looking line don't worry they're just doing a quick security check always moves quickly I've never been in line out here for more than like 10 minutes and that's rare even this line something it lasts like five minutes another thing is guys you can't wear hats ladies your shoulders have to be covered obviously it's easier to take a hat off than to cover your shoulders if you don't come prepared so ladies make sure you got something to cover them shoulders up you got to be modest we're in church this church actually has suffered some massive massive vandalization over the years the most recent the one the biggest is probably when the revolution took place and they turn this into a temple of reason I think that's when they decapitated the statues the have-nots all the statues a lot of the statues that they're still actually the heads are on display at one of the museums here in town the spire the 13th century spire was torn down so you come see the new big black gothic spire that's not old I mean it's old 180 years old hundred fifty years old there are a lot of additions and stylizations that changed in the 19th century as they're trying to modernize the Turks in France and so yeah I'm not sure I don't I'm not I don't know to what extent that all happened but it's really interesting to look at this stuff to recognize that well the church itself is in the range of like 850 years old something like that there are a lot of elements to it that aren't that old at all [Music] hats off anyway should have shaved before I did this it's gonna check your bag till you take your hat off no you no drinks or food or whatever inside and no flash photography but this kind of photography is okay because I'm not using a flash [Music] let's the adult some bleachers but normally what I like to do very first thing is walk straight to the center and look all the way up the church it's unbelievable and when they're using incense and stuff in here it gets kind of smoky this place gives you a good sense of just how ginormous this place is these bleachers are kind of ruining it but not entirely in whichever direction you want to go is fine from here but I tend to go counterclockwise I think that's the intended direction since the entrance is over here the exits over there just walk around check out the alcoves if you want to light a candle you can leave a donation to do that and if you're lucky they might be doing Mass or having a choir singing and it sounds incredible in here when they do basically czar for me to talk to you right now that they don't I'm kind of said that they don't have one going right now [Music] silence [Music] [Music] well so what we're missing at the top of the church are a couple things one is that there's actually a scale model of the entire church made out of wood so keep going around the top and definitely worth it the other thing is that there's actually an example maybe I'll talk outside at the church that we're missing out on unfortunately is a model of how they built the church it's really fascinating if you ever watch there's a cartoon we watched in French class in high school she's amazing but there's somebody like ingenuitive ways that they've actually built the arches everything one of the coolest things they built the arches in wood first and then set the stone into them and what they would do to get rid of the wood is it just burning and then the stone would set in place and there you go you have a stone arch it's incredible this whole place is amazing so if you haven't picked up on it yet yes I do think that this is totally worth it one other thing when you come out it looks like it's already closed for the day unfortunately but if you're facing the church to the left on the corner are the stairs to go all the way up and you can actually go up I don't know how much it is I'll put it on the screen try to look it up for you that number could change by the time you see this I don't know so no guarantees there but I do think it's worth it it's not my favorite view of the city not even top five favorite views of the city but if you want to get a better look at the arches if you want actually walk up and over the church see the towers the gargoyles up close that stuff is pretty cool I'll post a picture of you know one that I took when I went up there once gargoyle shot obligatory definitely really nice though very well worth it I hope you enjoyed this [Applause] [Music] yes it wasn't obvious I definitely think this place is worth it I love it I just love going in every once in a while just wander around enjoy it it's pretty awe-inspiring and to think that it's hundreds of years old and they just stacked a bunch of rocks up and to turn it into this it's amazing beautiful hope you enjoy now to get back to the regular vlog footage for those of you who were unaware I do vlog literally every day which hopefully the title screen gave that away but you'd be surprised and yeah back to the morning I had finished my blog this morning as well as I just conked out last night as is expected but you're not feeling your best well I figured out the mystery of my earbuds I'm pretty sure last night when happen was when I was trying to put the camera on the roof of that car didn't shovel that's just waiting outside the company Club angles oh oh oh and I didn't have my tripod and it started taking stuff out of my pockets like I can use this and use that try and prop it up mark toss me a pack of cigarettes like I couldn't get it to work it was just it wasn't happening I'm pretty sure that at that point they took my gear butts up where they fell out when I see her in my pocket probably put it I don't know if I left it on the car if it fell off to the side of the car but I hope that the owner of that car or somebody really enjoys their new earbuds the tragedy the tragedy anyways I'm gonna go for a run yeah I got a lot of stuff to get done today so I don't know what else is going to be in the vlog today but we'll see what we get done [Music] [Applause] Segway dog-walker dude is like one of my favorite parts of this park I don't he goes other parks internet but he's amazing for miles in some pace who knows I don't care I didn't actually pay attention when she said it's toasty out I mean it's not that hot but running in the Sun she's asked me if I was with the security detail that belongs to this car nope I'm just the sweaty guy in running shorts anyways I'm gonna go do this whole note or something and then I'm gonna try and get some work done I have a lot of admin stuff to get done today to try and start shipping books and it's gonna be a long painful process of doing so because we've got a ship each book individually but the hope is that it goes well so a lot of today is going to be spent just sitting at my computer nothing particularly exciting so let's go to see no DOM and that should be exciting enough for today [Music] I got a fair amount of work done just getting organized ordered proofs like physical copies of the books to check them out before I like commit and actually start ordering all the books for Kickstarter backers figure I have some time the fulfillment goal is by September and I'm gonna beat that at this rate so I figured take some time look at the actual paperback hardcover make sure that they're printed properly that everything is formatted well everything looks good works out and do all that before I commit to like you know a couple hundred books seems wise the other thing I did is I got started on my thank you stickers to patrons so I'm gonna try and get some of those mails today but I got like 30 of them done I got out of like 50 to go so actually was really nice just to sit and do that and chat with Rachel for a bit they're gonna go do this whole notes company that you've already
