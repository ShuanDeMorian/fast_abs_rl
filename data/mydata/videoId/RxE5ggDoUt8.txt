 hello or shall we say vlogger day 957 [Music] [Applause] good this morning the new microphone is supposed to be here last night it's not here hopefully the wind isn't to be a problem we're at the Pussycat I'm ready to take with not really I can feel it like this sure it compared to any Hill I'm all the way to fridge I'll talk to you more when we're at a less windy situations [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'll get you [Music] [Applause] yeah I didn't know that it made that much noise alright no meeting happened with Jeff because he's super busy because it's fashion week and he's swamped fashion week just making everything crazy anyways Laura's gonna join me for lunch really quick we're gonna she's gonna hop online since I've got my wheel and then she'll go hang out in etosha and I'm gonna go to another meeting and you know the day progresses maybe we were talking about earlier we'll figure this something ready and we made it's way better than walking ten times better than walking do you call to reopen is it open he's closed for lunch right now which is tragic I set up a meeting with him for next week which is great but food oh I know what I know what I I think I know what I crave right now Oh actually I want to try something there's something I want to try let's go see if it's open [Music] first is that a battery already that's the one of the downsides to these things they run out of battery after what like 30 minutes like that - aluminum Johnny - aunt sassy for mr. principal we're headed isn't what I first thought of when I went ooh but it's something that were wanting to try if it's closed or if we can't find it then we'll go to the place that it made me go woo over on the canal [Music] [Applause] [Music] no it did you have who off and I made the the dangerous mistake of trying to reach for it with my camera in my hand anyway its back on the road got to get got to get got to tighten this down or something [Music] [Applause] that's it wanted to try this ever since I saw it all of like two days ago are you returning it in as good condition as you found it do you mind opening the door I'm encumbered [Music] oh we need to my microphone should be waiting for me when I get home so hope followed by scaffolding everywhere everywhere I go anyway despite the scaffolding which is one of the most horrific allowed aspects of living in Paris that was delicious the chicken was great I really really really like the chicken head for 10 euros it was 10 euros for that entire meal per person great view Deborah we're gonna head to the river I've got to get this thing checked out hopefully get the wheel inflated because it's a little bit flat and gravity Space Invader and then we'll lose you to Natasha and I'm gonna go to another meeting mine doesn't sing it just beeps [Applause] I think I have this one I've known about this one for years but I've just never I came through on a live stream once and couldn't get it cuz I was live streaming so this now I have it finally okay we're close my wheel is feeling very flat but my hope is that they can fill it up for me maybe I'll even buy a helmet today if they order the one that I asked for otherwise probably [Music] you don't want to get an electric wheel of some kind of got all these foods but she's in love with her scooter I'm just saying earu these guys are great and the right body goes not moving very central come get your wheel from these guys I'm trying to buy my helmet from them but they just won't keep them in stock this is the one I want but I want this in orange also they like I said they don't have any of these but the nice thing is once you take it off it flattens and go right in my backpack neither here nor there Peru this guy's great we have plans just had some ideas that I floated by them and I think this already feels so much better know that it's included okay we're gonna go get a space invader that just got reactivated and I've been wanting forever ever since I found out that it was no longer existent it's on the bike tour route if you take a bike about tour which I'm gonna try and do here soon as well but we're gonna get this right now [Music] I don't know if it's real or not they're tiny little tiles nope but the impressed that I saw it your mom's gonna love today's video I'm gonna swing by the peloton do you want to go with me or do you want to just leave no a bit I mean just say hi okay sounds good let's do you got also spinning around a pole is a lot of fun to you [Music] oh snap that is something I order in a way to the money if that's it go to wrong address my microphone is here I am prepared for this because I actually also breath : I also brought the fuzzy cat with it goes I'll show you go to capture your reaction to how this works in real time goes like this Oh anyways I'll plug this in well that's just right okay I'm talking at a regular volume and then we push this in and then what happens we won't know until we edit it later but hopefully yeah of improvements you won't ever know we're gonna never gonna give you up never let you down [Music] I really admire you [Music] yeah we got like one cemetery [Music] and then figure out how to get the fuzzy cat on I don't even know if this is functioning but this is the perfect opportunity to see if it's working for the win because it's really windy out here right now let you see without the microphone that's what the microphone just for find out just how effective this is when I edit [Music] the 17 different video to she she based on Maison she's guys are officially are officially in the game even that hasn't much good sir hey yeah you'll see her again very soon a lot of her probably up yeah yeah very serious too that's good okay it's raining in my camera's full which is good cuz I don't want to use my camera in the rain I'm not sure how much wheeling I'm gonna do cuz I gotta go find the metro from here the rains not that bad but I think I get soaked by the time I got too far so debating go hop in the Metro here that was amazing so she's technically the first person who's actually officially in it's great I love that place to the wonderful spot so I realized the other thing we were talking about today was that tomorrow by the time you're seeing this today for you is my two-year anniversary of coming back to Paris so how fitting is it that on the two-year anniversary or less we signed our first waypoint for the game I'm excited right I'll see to get my I gotta stop coming so I get do this thing this is not raining over here that's exciting I'm excited I'm looking forward to seeing where this all goes but it's just I don't know just feels mildly momentous I even actually wrote first next to the notes that I was taking with her and yeah we decided as we were talking the goal is going to be to launch the game on March 11th which is also my mother's birthday which is a perfect day to launch it there'll be a lot more information to come maybe Saturday is the day that I'm gonna actually have like the time and energy to explain what's going on more specifically but it was a great day just the freedom of flying around on my wheel is amazing I found the instructions unfortunately all in German for the fuzzy cat I'll hopefully get the fuzzy cat figured out we'll see what the tests are like obviously you know now how well this the the non fuzzy cat just the regular spit guard works let's see how this adds to it but in the meantime I'm gonna go ahead and wrap it up for today I've already lost my hat and dirtied it once my pants are even more dirty than they usually are and I am just exhilarated I think it's great if only it hadn't started raining I would have written that thing all the way home would have been wonderful or at least I written it as far home as I could've possibly but you know you got to call it quits at some point and the rain was enough to get me to do that for today so I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for I believe a bike tour I think when you go on a bike about tour tomorrow for those of you that haven't seen it or that didn't see back when I was a tour guide with them a little bit of a preview as to what you'll get to see when you're on a bike about tour as well actually what I'm gonna be trying to do tomorrow is counting every single Space Invader that's on the tour because he's reactivated some so there's some new ones that are up and I'll share those with you at least some of them as they go and also the Meetup if you see this in time the meetup Friday night which should be tonight when this release is 8 o'clock bon Esprit if you're watching this after March 1st 2019 too late you missed it all right I'll see you [Music]
