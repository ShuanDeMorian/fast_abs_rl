 it's like a 1001 which is how many marathons I've completed in my short life eat that good morning and welcome to a beautiful day in Paris today is the first day of my 20 in 20 what is 20 and 20 basically gonna spend the next 20 days hitting every single arrondissement in Paris one at a time if you need a quick overview in arrondissement is basically a district in Paris municipal district they have their own mayors they kind of have their own ways of doing things and they look like this they spiral out from the center starting at number 1 which is where I'm at today and work their way all the way up to number 20 which is really big and out in the north-east and that's basically the rundown on one of the neurons mont is if you're looking for that map all the stuff I'm gonna show you today plus lots more you grab my guide I wrote a guide to the city that I'll be talking about over the course the next three weeks as well but enough of that let's get started right in front of me is the Louvre you can't see it because it's in front of me hold on let me put it behind me the Louvre is a ginormous Museum if you haven't heard of it before I'm surprised because it is the number one most touristed museum in the world and I don't know how many other statistics it holds but it is ridiculously large I'm just gonna go ride I don't know why we're talking about it from out here let's go inside [Music] the Louvre is huge but I wanted to start over on this side because the two leaders are basically up against the edge of the first around a small we're in the first Ronnie's mom case I didn't mention that before starting at the top but the tiller gardens are lovely and they stretch all the way over the plastic encore plus the Conchords all the way over there we're gonna walk in for just a second the problem is that I can't ride my wheel so don't know how far end of this we're gonna be able to get [Music] it's pretty empty out here right now because it's early it's cold and it's you know Saturday what's everybody sleeping in but there is one secret that you should know about the Tuileries it's a wonderful place to come sit most of the French parks like this have chairs outside so you can sit around the water and have a nice picnic this area is gonna be really crowded right in the middle of the Tuileries it's always overloaded with people however on either side are more fountains just off to the edges it's not that far away that so few people ever actually go to so grab your charcuterie you know whatever it is you want to have for your picnic and then go off to the sides o to Leary protip the louver itself is monstrous look at this thing it's got so much art in it it's a ridiculous amount of art don't feel the pressure to see all of it on your first visit but if you do want to see it quickly and efficiently I did make a video about that which you can out link to for sure which includes secret entrances to the Louvre because they're very open secrets but the pyramids are the most famous entrance to the Louvre but the pyramids are just a security clearance they're not the actual entrance into the museum itself you still got to go through the whole ticket process once you're inside and the lines there can be outrageous so if you want to get through lines more quickly the way to do it is to hop in one of those secret entrances and that's in that video that I made before usually there's traffic in here but this is a Saturday they've got a lot of traffic shut down down here now those of you that are concerned about the G Legion which is why they have a number of things shut down at the moment you don't need to be I mean look at us we're not worried about it I'm not worried about it it does affect a couple of areas of town there a few metro stops that are shut down hopefully this doesn't matter for long but just in case you were thinking like oh maybe I won't go to Paris maybe I won't visit maybe I won't go there to study so he actually asked me once do it come have a good time it's only on Saturdays and only in certain parts of town that it affects anybody and it's pretty easy to avoid look at the size of this place I love this place [Music] that's the loof there are couple other spots you probably want to see if you're the first around his mama Paris and I made a mistake today where I didn't make a mistake it's just a scheduling problem the main scheduling problem right now is that it's Saturday and one of the two coffee shops that I really know in like in in the surroundings month is closed on Saturdays and the other one it doesn't open till 11:00 a.m. and I haven't had my coffee yet today so that guy's got his so in order to get my coffee today I'm probably gonna have to wait but in the meantime we've seen the Tuileries we've seen Louvre the Palais Royale is just over here I'm gonna try and hold onto that last because if I am gonna get coffee it's gonna be there so we'll go see a couple other things we'll see how long I lasted out caffeine it's gonna be a great adventure the other two spots you want to see are gonna be layout place vendôme classmen dome is one that is very ritzy famously wealthy it's a ridiculous area and then the other is the opposite it's not on the complete opposite end of the shopping spectrum but it's a it's a little bit less ritzy it is fancier they've redone it I'll show you [Music] if you haven't gathered already Saturday mornings pretty magical for going around because there's nobody up and about the same as Sunday Sunday's are even better just thinks if you want anything to be open also Church this is the beginnings of Chatelet Leal shuttle a Leal is a combination of Chatelet and layout layout being the word for a warehouse market kind of a combination of things this park is actually pretty nice they've done a lot of work on it it is over the top of what is famously known as layout it is the layout right behind me which is one of the world's largest underground shopping malls it's what I was referring to and I said that was kind of on the opposite end of the shopping spectrum they've also finished work on this church [Music] this square also contains some new stash which is a fantastic Church it's beautiful it's huge I actually don't think I've ever been inside because they've always assumed I think feel like they've always been doing construction on it but now it's clearly visible it might go around the front here see if we get inside really quickly we have to go into layout for just a second and make her way back towards plasmon though [Music] I've never been in this church before it's pretty phenomenal very different from I mean if you like every Church in Paris different but this one just absolutely soars I was really neat I've always wanted to go in there and that's kind of the fun of doing this whole 2020 project I thought I might as well do some exploring while I'm also showing you things that love now as far as things that love a little run through late al here and I can show you a really fun fountain there's not a lot around here that I'm particularly fond of as far as food goes coffee places we're not far from a number of coffee places but it lay al itself is kind of in my opinion but it does have lots of options and there's a lot to explore so there's probably some really good stuff here I just haven't found yet so if you want to come shopping here you're bound to find something delicious and look at the size of this place that recently finished it and it's this is this is a monster shopping experience it may not look like much from the top but then you got to realize that it also goes down like I don't even know how many stories underground [Music] this place is monstrous also lego store for those of you who have kids who are looking for you know your French Legos seriously look at this they've got the Lego Notre Dom set up this is also the largest metro station in the entire city something like eight hundred thousand people pass through just this station every day it's got rara lines it's got metro lines it's got everything what it doesn't have is content is in a song which is where we're gonna bounce next is right next door oh also bonus for those of you who are into space invader come right out the center here take a left and then you zip over here it's so great I love the zipping part this wheel makes mold life so much better and just over here on the next turn you got the Smurfs invader the number one redeeming aspect of Leal is that there are ton of space invaders around here so if you're going space invader hunting doesn't take long to wander and find like Bugs Bunny Oscar the Grouch tons of great space invaders but for the moment we're interested in Fontaine is in a song [Music] looks like they have you have to turn it on but they will soon I am sure it is a beautiful fountain it's the oldest ornamental fountain in the city it's something like five hundred years old gorgeous has a space invader on it has a space invader next to it and it's just a great spot to sit and eat your lunch caveat to that though this is an area that's pretty famous for its pickpockets petty crime so make sure that you keep an eye on your stuff we've reached the edge of the first around these mom if we keep going that way we're gonna wander into the fourth so instead of doing that let's head back this way you got two more things we want to see maybe some coffee to get probably not coffee to get I mean if we're being honest pretty sure that at this stage the coffee game is pure optimism here's Oscar the Grouch by the way there's another smaller harder to find the space invader right next to him I hope you discover that on your own in the meantime let's bounce the glass then don't we've got a long ways to go it's like on the far end of all this [Music] possibly the best part of this entire thing is gonna be discovering new space invaders there's also this giant thing I don't know what it is exactly I think it's got different offices and like places to eat and so forth off to my left here I'll show it to ya it's where I first saw rollerblading cops which was kind of one of the happiest moments of my life so let's see we can't we'll go left it's not what I thought it was if I find that thing that I'm thinking of I'll let you know but this is not what I thought it was not sure how I feel about it to be honest okay moving on through the 18th is the in the first is he in the second I'll let you decide he's definitely right on the corner I always thought this is Louie the 14th but the Roman numerals on the back of this say 18 what Louie XVI yeah what that what I totally thought this is louis xiv this whole time learning something new every day okay I'm currently a plastic Victoire going around in circles at the roundabout because you know why not you know it's just a Saturday activity technically I think this place is half in the first half in the second there's something really cool just over there we're gonna have to wait till tomorrow because tomorrow is when we're gonna go into the second now that we have gone around in circles forever we're gonna go ahead and exit the roundabout and make our way back finally hopefully towards class vendôme now thankfully on the way to place vendôme right next to it is one of the bakeries that i recommend it's in my five best croissants I think or Penta struggle ah ah but that's the thing I was looking for earlier we'll go check that out after we get a pen a struggle ah so they are a chain and they're in my list of trustworthy chains basically like places you know you can go to get a good croissant anywhere in the city if you happen to stumble across one the name of the place is Erik Kaiser and I'm really excited to get a croissant from them because I have yet to eat anything today and yeah let's rectify that I needed this I haven't eaten anything today it's a bad bad call should never never go like riding around town without eating anything it was good panache like a lot I have a lunch place in mind and a drinks place in mind for you later as well which I guess at this rate our going to get crammed in at the end because we've basically seen everything I just inhaled some pastry flakes I'm gonna finish eating this and then let's go to plasmin dome check out the mystery building see what the heck that is and then I actually have to go help a friend film a thing I gotta do some green screen stuff I'll explain that later maybe and then we'll do lunch and drinks after that sounds great if you didn't get my terrible joke earlier didn't realize is a terrible joke that's cuz the Ritz is here that's why I call this place ritzy haha it was really funny anyways this is a place where you can go buy really overpriced stuff or stay in a really expensive hotel or you know I don't know Louie Vuitton is here whatever Patek Phillipe is you can tell this is not exactly my scene but it's pretty cool and at Christmas they filled it at least this year with Christmas trees it's kind of exciting and also directly behind me is the two Lurie so you want to go back to the gardens you can do so from here with ease it's for the nice I had tea here once I'll link to that as well tea at the Ritz thanks Anna it was a fantastic experience okay so moving on from here let's go check out the mystery building and then Palais Royale and if we're lucky we might even managed to score ourselves a delicious coffee at Cafe kitsune here we go [Music] this is Marsha I am a vice I'd never put those two names together Marsha saw on a lit really it's kind of disappointing anyways this building is big and modern and apparently they sell a lot of furniture at least on the ground level ooh there's the market out there ok let's go check out the market really quick I was gonna say if they got rid of the real market entirely this is a bit depressing but it looks like we still have a little bit of market out here which man see let's see if we can get underneath this the markets of course are one of the best parts about living in France anywhere you are in the city on any given day you should be able to find at least one market markets like this aren't open every day but they're open a couple days a week and so you should be able to find a market wherever you are there's a nice very small I like it I haven't never seen this one before I don't think if you're doing shopping for yourself markets are a great way to save a little bit of money especially on fruits and vegetables it's just fun it's a fun experience you've made some interesting people obviously there are some do sure's you know they can't all be winners but a lot of times going to a market it's a great way to meet some interesting local people get some delicious produce and especially right now man the strawberries holy smokes so good there's so much good fruit available right now you should definitely go for that okay we've got one food thing down and oh the Spider Man hold on okay we have our croissant down we didn't get coffee yet we're gonna hopefully get that we do have most of the like photogenic touristy sights down but one of the things if you're hunting for space invaders you should know that's in this area can't tell you exactly where it is because that would be cheating but I can't tell you what's around here is a Spider Man Space Invader that's right spider-man Space Invader holy smokes if that's not the best part of your day I don't know who you are okay Palais Royale [Music] this is the Palais Royale antastic the beautiful location formerly royal residence currently filled with shocking and a wonderful wonderful Park you've seen this before if you don't know what I'm about to show you you have seen it before I'm racing past the park part to get to that part because the park parts where the coffee part is and I want to get back to the coffee part after this part because I'm hoping that I get some coffee anyway moving forward to the colonnades now you saw the video where I went and I did a photo shoot with Ellen AM who you should definitely follow and also booked for a photo shoot if you're in Paris we came here it's one of the most popular most famous locations for photoshoots fashion shoots people love coming here having their photo taken and you can see why we haven't even gotten to the stripey bits and the stripy bits might even be the best bits you can climb up on these things take all kinds of photos nobody even yell at you if you climb on stuff and I don't know if I'm really supposed to be riding my wheel around here but everybody's pretty cool and likes the wheels even though they don't like the scooters which works out really well in my benefit really wheel in my benefit going that far [Music] are we done the columns check out the part this Park is also really pretty [Music] alright we've seen the park we've seen the colonnade we've seen just about everything the first has to offer which isn't true there's actually a lot more you can explore if you were here it's small but the first is jam-packed with nice pretty things to look at but is it filled with nice pretty things to drink that's the real question we'll kitsune be open or will it not this is also a party recognized from the newest Mission Impossible movie when it comes to like talk to what's her face in the trees this is where they did that that they could soon a will you be open one of the things that I didn't explain which I probably explained again some other video down the line is where the idea of a 20 and 20 came from talk about this a couple days ago cafe kitsune is it open does that do that they're open it's Coffee time [Music] I worked out turned out Google lied they were open at 10:00 this morning but it worked out fine because you know what accomplished a lot this morning managed to see the entirety of the first around these mom and all of like what less than two hours really zipping around because I mean the wheel really helps it that I'm gonna hold on one second it's really good this is probably my favorite coffee shop in the first for you guys you can sit outside and watch the park see the world pass you by in a really chill environment and it's it's delightful now from here I need to go to the YouTube space after I finish this to help my buddy Boone film some green screen elements which I probably can't show you anything because the YouTube space won't let me film and then publish without them reviewing it and I don't have time to let anybody review my vlog because it goes up the next day and we're gonna come back here have lunch I'll show you a really good spot for dumplings I'll show you a really great spot to have a drink on the river and then I'll probably wrap it up there and then you will be well prepared to explore the first all on your own if you find yourself staying here I just want to confine your exploration to one or on his MA at once that's enough for me talking about coffee time [Music] place is so delicious I just dream of those dumplings alright from here ms la maison for a drink it's actually working out pretty well I've earned my lunch and a beer by the river I think I'm hopefully I'll meet my buddy Jake there for a minute before he goes and runs the Paris marathon tomorrow my final stop Maison Maison these guys are in the game as well if you haven't heard about the game yet make sure you're playing the game when you come to Paris get some stickers another goodie find out more about it but these guys have some goodies too I kept gonna sit here have a beer relax after carrying my wheel much farther than I wanted to and probably call it quits I will see you back here again tomorrow bright and early for the second around his mountain Paris and the remainder of my 20 and 20 the remainder is the continuation of my 20 20 I'll see you tomorrow [Music] it's a rough life
