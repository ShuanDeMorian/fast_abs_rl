But not too badly - I tend to be careful when I do.\r\n\r\nWhy are you living in #Paris? - Because I've always wanted to; I feel at home here: https://youtu.be/4Vivf6MqMxQ\r\n\r\nDo you speak French? Oui. https://youtu.be/va1QjaHgij8\r\n\r\nYou talk a lot about the books you're working on, what are they about? - They're sci-fi (and fantasy) and I've got a decent pitch for you here: https://youtu.be/W2bKt4_Tp4E\r\n\r\nDo you make money off YouTube? - Ha, no.
