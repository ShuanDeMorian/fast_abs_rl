Paris hold on by the way I need to apologize for the quite horrific French accent that I'm gonna proceed to do over the next two days it's cold what a big coke oh good drop bag to the hotel and it on to breakfast time it's amazing I'm just into two rooms in the center of Paris places man that quick stop off at the Hoxton who dropped our bags here we had a little tour around this place is beyond impressive why I'm so hungry we'll get some proper French pastries apparently they do this like pistachio Danish which sounds just awesome pastry turn this will come to see owned by Christoph Vassar and make him bread like they did hundred years ago Joe resting about two days everything cooked in the wood oven this has been recommended to us by maxium owner of bran shet we featured them before and top jaw is like when the best French restaurants in London carwell smell already finish Naz in their layouts we're all probably gonna pace ourselves the worst I think about this place is the anxiety about choosing a dish shuttlepod she's struggling to understand a thing I think my things to do right in there because nobody spoke back to me in English it's an escargot with chocolate and pistachio this is like the Apple and cream puff and this is an almond cross on can I go yet well yes eat well a petite mm yeah thanks Maxine recommendation always trust a French man way to recommending Parisian bakeries top floor top tip we got there late morning no queue now it's me most time queue Zilla basically it's busy bakery okay it's very very good lacked a trio well that's not the constituted will Caesar think that every single artist in Paris is probably the article we are in Louw Marie injunction on a very premium confectioner suite of chocolates and more high-fashion products probably four are things at home yeah okay let's see if they lasted for hours a thank you very much loving this oh yeah I've had a lot of mint flavor chocolate my life but a lot of that you could taste so much fresh mint this is a bit of jelly mango flavor flav pectin no German or vegan this plate opened in September last year so only be about four months they don't like a collection change but every three weeks some themes always stay constant so that they always have a chocolate one they always have a caramel one we asked Frank was two favorites were it's a creme brulee and the chocolate banana one your healthy starts of the day may have chocolate um as a top drawer recommended right the things would be really dense because quite like little stock to unit of a doughnut so it's basically completely fill the banana cream hello first of my teammates up country coming in close for camera this is ma che there's an Fort Rouge the reason why I got his name is because there used to be in the 16th century if an orphanage who set on the site and I've lived do you know is that the food here is amazing and you could you take away or you can sit in little stools kinda like a street food market and some that artisanal and organic products as well this is a goldmine of food the correct that this guy is serving of is like nothing I've ever seen we've got mr. superhero here looks just like it's out of four I think we've become really accustomed to street food markets now there's like loads in London there's loads in pretty much every UK city but this one is really really worth coming to every single stand town I want that one that one that I should own that that's that's it I want having a glass of wine some cheese over there oh there's someone say cheese don't you first allow for the Thursday May that is a lot to camembert this is called a month door especially they have a very small menu and I think they changed quite a lot the food here looks so much more high-end than you'd expect in a market place so far so good hitting quite a lot of spots and then we don't necessarily advise you cramming as much as we do but we're does here to try the well we're trying to find the best coffee place around we heard that the fringe is the one we've read worried about overload young grub and having a bit of a lull couple of sides out well [Music] like cookies again wasn't the plan but looked like unavoidable the guy in their city thinks that there's a lot of parallels between coffee and photography because of the craft and the kind of the amount of precision that goes into it may I drink a lot of oat milk flat whites that one dude that's high up there look like that will juice of goddess right there chocolate chip hazelnut cookie warm very soft very goo kick it out top notch koala one the best over a lot is a bad respect a friend ruins Paris just like in London the East is the kind of younger more fashion eco district we realize that we've timed our visit around Men's Fashion Week in Paris so there's a lot of Easter's aloud are we fashionistas well [Music] started chocolate down rain so we thought well after staying in the best hotel in Paris it's come back here have a couple of drinks and make a plan for the evening second glass of wine is a we don't jest to get a bit slower we do well this is the reveille bar in Hoxton open to anyone's you got to be staking you can does coming in and have a drink or some food or work it's past 5:00 p.m. now so we've moved on to the hard stuff here we have a truffle margarita I like that a lot this is the smallest room called the shoebox and the Hoxton it's ample and it's sexy isn't it well as everything in the Hoxton attention to detail is immense and they have the little survival guide here surrounding map we want a list of places with a lot of girls make it all over each night you can do as many as you possibly can as you get pizza we'll come on we've heard about this Big Mama group there's lots of restaurants all over Paris one of which is pizzeria popular so pizzeria popular a and now I retorted you say that we call it history of popular it's basically a piece of

outsides always busy might be the most unfriendly she can go in Paris we've got a surf by one guy from Cambridge nothing by from Stratford we are going to provide the antidote for that I'm gonna find the most French place we could possibly find just to give you a balance Roger Allegra Neil the most rate restaurant we could possibly find like you're told by the guys but they didn't get made tourists in here this place worth opened in like the 1930s right Meredith he was a real legend around town lots of craters in here those are parties and is renowned as one of the best places for folks

have a croque monsieur's so in here the upper hand and both of cheese from Switzerland bread which is actually cooked in loads and loads of butter our ghetto well probably that light and sweet and you

Bearnaise sauce wine sauce and garlic aioli yeah Olli mmm kind like a fishier texture and chicken fly only bangs in my mouth these are frog legs there's another way there's all Freddy the Frog it's dipped into her Fred over there we want something super French I've never had frog legs before I never had snails before molecular nil is the best place for this sort of thing we can't be very close to anybody from now on in because our mouths our garlic see so in this guide we weren't gonna focus on many of the sort of obvious tourist spots but most jobs are thieves and we'll have something inside so try and keep that camera subtle because they won't like it - this actually must say to you oh yeah I want to build this Sylve go take the celery juice yeah can you like just just give us
