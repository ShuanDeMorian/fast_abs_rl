 Baga day 723 that's a difficult question because I didn't know we were in the information society today I'm gonna try and buy a new pair of shorts national sales which happen twice a year France because the French government actually regulates when clearance sales can happen in the country it's a six-week period and it's basically the only time during the May that I shop in France because let's be honest other rice is just outrageously expensive to buy anything around here so we're gonna go find some shorts I figured I'd show you three areas and the city they're famous for their shopping between the Marais Chevy and the shops of this a and yes they all sorta rhyme but that's French but everything rhymes in French and they don't even realize it half the time so let's go do that but first things first well first things first probably were hacked is totally sunny outside and second things first [Music] side to milk all Pauls really for candy I'm going into the candy in this it's gonna turn the idea thanks matt has its own YouTube channel that's what this is from I will link to it if you're into gaming channels and English accents I do this is amazing but wrapping paper doesn't doesn't work as well as you think this is really super but amazing yeah that is awesome I think I don't have this one thank you any fear who sent this because somebody tweeted and he asked me if I'd gotten this yesterday and I don't know who that was so I didn't figure that up and thank you that name I'll put it up when I figure it out I really appreciate it this is exciting [Music] Laure the newbie to the the pellets on his gonna dread me as well for this walk basically my thought was we walk through the Marais over towards Chet's lay and then up the champs elysées like I said but probably should get lunch in there as well which is one of the joys of shopping right stopping for lunch a long way how's the Hat look let me know in the comments below that saves me thanks Matt I was really not wanting to buy a hat and glad this showed up so now I'm set for a while and there's one other thing I've seen about buying but I might I might hold off on that sales in France I was just explaining to Jonas and Laura can pick him whenever she wants she's French so she can correct me if I'm wrong at any point but Clarence sales are only allowed during two months out of the year to six week windows once in January and once in July effectively otherwise stores aren't allowed to have clearance sales it's actually governed by the state so we are currently in clearance sale time and that's why it's national sales everywhere so when you see the word sold in the windows means that they're having sales [Music] the number one recommendation in the marais is ms not everyone will tell you about Lada falafel if you want to get falafel but miss none is basically French Israeli fusion but I got us the beef bourguignon and a Peter which I only ever get like 50 percent of the time because usually out and it is amazing I'm really hungry where do you get [Music] okay okay now that we're fed we can get back on it I am like the worst person to be talking about sales because I'm like the least consumeristic person I don't buy anything but it's why I have the goal of getting shorts at least the thing is everywhere you go in the city right now everything is gonna be on sale too sir even this place a very like soap supplements and stuff they're all the way up to fifty percent open 70 percent over here that's good the strategy is that over time the sales get better so you have to kind of balance between like as time goes on the sales get deeper up to 70% right I think it's pretty nuts but the inventory drops as well because it's a clearance sale so you kind of have to keep your eye on what you want see when that balance comes between like it's cheap enough but still available or you miss it forever Marie is a great spot to go we're gonna start walking towards Chataway which is like the number one shopping spot in Paris pretty much just for its tube density and then we'll head up we're making a quick detour as well this is one of those space invaders was one that I thought I've been taken down so I'd never went back to fighting because I thought it was gone really good to find that I'm at 199 I almost have 200 space invaders but if you're not here with the street art Banksy was just here in Paris and a lot of them have been two-faced and taking down you go to Instagram you can see the one that I posted earlier but this one's right by Pompey you and it's awesome I love Banksy - great - good 200 that's - 200 I found Joan I can retire now just kidding I'm never gonna retire back to the sales I promise I'll get back to the sales [Music] this is Shepley which is the world's largest underground shopping mall so shopping central and all the streets around us are pretty much nothing but retail restaurants yes overpriced restaurants generally and not always the best restaurants I wouldn't recommend eating here get lunch in the Marais or république but end up here for like a lot of like very dense shopping very very quickly we're gonna go through the mall here for a second and down to the Metro where we'll head up to the champs elysées but figure we'd give you this view because this is we're gonna go shopping in Paris this is not a this is good this is a spot to go oh there's there's I do not have that one sorry this is space invader media today you actually would [Music] actually sealeo is where i was planning on going on the champs-elysees anyways we can check this out and see how this works but I get my pants every time so it's not an endorsement it just happens to be the way words and 10% off everything because we got a t-shirt along what she'll see eventually so this is what sales are all about the shopping mall has everything in it and it is the world's largest underground mall and they just recently finished renovating it so it's interesting I would say that like the new architecture is kind of beautiful but it took me a minute to get used to it it's kind of just like a spaceship out of an alien movie but that's kind of cool I guess anyways none of the metro and then we'll go show you the shop still easy and then that'll be that [Music] the name deschamps alizée is probably the most famous shopping walk in the world I don't think there's one that's even more than anywhere remotely as famous as this lots of brands that are on the higher end lots of expensive stuff but there's some cheaper stuff too you see leo the brand where i got the shorts they're up here they've got a really big store up here hmm is here there's a McDonald's here I mean it's not like it's not fancy really at the end of the day well come on tipo I asked Sephora's here as well yeah what else anything off the Disney Store is here Louie Vuitton where she gets all her handbags Louboutin Chanel ever everything is here basically and then there are guys that will give you they'll rent you a Lamborghini for 15 minutes if you're really desperate so you give that a try as well but we're just gonna walk up and get all the way the top it's a long walk all the way up you can do a lot of shopping here [Music] if you did make a video on the differences between French and American McDonald's go check that out if you're interested in what the differences are between the McDonald's is it's still not a satisfying meal just say that much and of course if you're walking in the heat like this then you probably end with a drink beer we're gonna go into the public drugstore here it's this really big pharmacy on the end on the edge of the city or at the end of this absolutely say that happens do is kind of like a mini general store but they have drinks in here so if you don't want to sit at like one of the tables skip going to the restaurant we're gonna do is we're gonna grab a drink in here and then go sit by the Arc de Triomphe and just enjoy the sights while we're this I know I look ridiculous right now but I'm just trying to keep the Sun off my neck leave me alone [Music] there you go that was really fun actually bought some shorts for once in a new shirt which I definitely needed I'm just I'm like the worst shopper ever though be like it was it was good that Laura came with me because otherwise I'm just not motivated to shop much so obviously the video helped to we were fine with somebody else though and if you're wondering why I don't shop or buy stuff much you know just go back here and watch some of my videos from how my life has been for hopefully that helps you given I have an idea of why you should be here in July or January if you want to save money on clearance sales and next year you're gonna shorten the window a little bit so be paying attention that would be four weeks instead of six but they're also gonna try and implement something similar to a Black Friday we'll see how that goes probably kind of exciting now I gotta go do your laundry speaking of clothes cuz I'm like running out pretty much all out [Music] if you enjoyed today's video I have made others that might be of reality like I think I linked above to things like cheaper free things to do in Paris of course there five great views of the city less different stuff I'm gonna be making even more this week actually and they're coming couple of weeks I just realized you know it's tourism peak season people probably pretty interested so tomorrow I wasn't planning on doing this but Laura is here actually to learn more about the coffee scene in Paris she's French but his little being been living in Australia for a while so she's actually hasn't seen a lot of the coffee shops around town so I'm bumping up my plan to do five great coffee shops in Paris so if you want to see five great the best is probably how I'm gonna title it but there five great of the best rather the best coffee shops in Paris I'm gonna be showing you that tomorrow she'll join me for that in the morning and then of course I have some other stuff gonna do and then I'm going to do five penile chakra for French Friday and Alex is gonna join me for that nice guy so we're gonna go do that together and explore some Patrick alone which is it's hard to say no to the meantime we're gonna be loners so thanks for watching if you
