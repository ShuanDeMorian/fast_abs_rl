 [Music] in Paris and we are here for a few days so I thought it would be fun to vlog my trip I'm really sorry if I sound weird but I'm not feeling too well but it's just typical that I've been looking forward to this trip and then I get a bit ill but oh well so we actually arrived late last night and it's now next morning and we're about to go and get something to eat so I thought I'd take you along with me I've got this really cute pink pearly bear a that I have from Topshop and I really want to wear it but I also feel a little bit of an idiot in it so this is what the very looks like I don't know whether to wear it or not I do feel a little bit like an idiot in here but it's so cute it's pink and pearly I've decided I'm just gonna wear it I'm gonna be brave and I've got my Miss Selfridge cute pink coat with like the little furry bit it's so cute and pretty yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we just booked all the way up [Music] [Music] [Music] so we just start ages trying to find that make some roads restaurant because it's really pink appreciate huge film crew that so many pictures is now Saturday and as you can probably tell by my voice I really I'm not feeling very well I was how kind of hoping that I would be feeling like a bit better rather than a bit worse and I just I feel really awful but I'm determined to try and not let it ruin the trip but I hope it's not too gross for you to watch sorry that I didn't film too much yesterday in the afternoon evening my boyfriend actually had his phone stolen from him so we have all of that to deal with and it kind of like discovered our plans for the afternoon evening because we were going to go to larger eh but hopefully we will go there on another day instead I think we're gonna head to like a Marie Antoinette style Tea Room which looks so cute and pink and pretty and because I've not really been feeling that well I just decided to put on this really cozy white jumper that's got this lovely lacy bit yeah I actually got it from Primark and it was super cheap and I just really liked it [Music] it's now about seven o'clock and we've come back to the hotel room for a little bit so I thought I would just show you what I got from the Murray and one tea room that we went to earlier I decided to buy one of the Marie Antoinette teas which comes in a cute little box like this and the actual tea room was called Nina's and the actual the tea comes in the cutest little pink tin like how adorable is so it's a unique French teeth is flavored with fresh fruits of acai I think it's the only teeth its flavored with fresh apples from the Kings kitchen garden in Versailles so it's quite a specialty and I just had to pick one up because it's a really cute sorry about my voice by the way it hasn't only better and a lovely shot oh who was so nice she gave me the sell assortment of teas as well which has lots on there sorry I didn't really film any kind of talkie bits of the vlog since like earlier on but it was raining loads today and I look and sound a bit like a frog but I think we're gonna go and see the Eiffel Tower all lit up and sparkly and pretty shout out to my boyfriend by the way for letting me drag him to all the cute girly places because it's definitely not his thing but he just does it anyway because he knows I'm just in my absolute element so I just touched my hair and makeup up a little bit and now I think we are gonna go ahead health into Paris and to the Eiffel Tower [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it's now our last day and if you're wondering why the whole background looks a little different is because we had to change hotel rooms but that's like a whole other story but we're going to go out today to the shop Elysee I want to say that's how you pronounce it I'm not really sure rubbish with all French pronunciations and things but yes we're gonna go do a lot of shopping and hopefully go to larger a as well yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] it's now almost a week later since the last clip that I filmed and I just didn't really film anything else after that as I started to just not really feel well at all and that was the end of the trip anyway and it's slightly annoying that this happened during the trip but these things happen that's life I guess but I wanted to just film at this little clip for the end of the vlog because I had a couple of things that I bought that I wanted to show I couldn't leave Paris and not take anything back with me from ladder a and I had to get some macarons and they come in this really cute little box I got like the classic ladder a mint green color but how cute is that little bag with the little ribbon and then also when I was in the airport we had some euros leftover so I thought I would get a perfume and this one stood out to me it's called my Burberry and it's called blush and I think it's like a new version of the my Burberry perfume and it just snot really nice plus the bottle is like so pretty actually it smells like the super fresh but when it dries down it actually dries down like a little bit fruity which I kind of wasn't really expecting but it's really nice all the same so I just thought I would show you those hopefully the next time you see me in a video I will be a much better health but if you did like this video give it a thumbs up if you
