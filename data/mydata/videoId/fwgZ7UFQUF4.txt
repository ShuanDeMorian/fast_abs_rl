 that's the beautiful smell of trash in the morning today is vlog and a 1005 [Music] good morning and welcome to day 5 of my 20 and 20 starting right next to the music Duke uni in the fifth you want to see the Middle Ages Museum the National Middle Ages Museum it is pretty sick and then on the other side ku tomb finish Institute I don't know if they started it or if they took it over bukka tomb is a local coffee roaster and make some tasty coffee and the Finnish Institute is supposed to be a really nice place to sit chill maybe even get some work tunnel that I don't think they allow laptops so you're gonna have to do some good old-fashioned book studying okay I'm gonna head down to the river check on the old dame as well as get a coffee at a famous place that you probably you probably know about already but I just feel like going because they've got a wonderful view if nothing else [Music] she didn't know about this spot this is pretty fantastic this is a great photo location okay I'm going to Shakespeare and company I'm going to their cafe they've opened the cafe how long ago their coffee is really good they have a fantastic view of the church which I'm gonna go take advantage of before people line up and take all the seats but if you come you've got this really cool gothic fence I don't know what to call this exactly with a fantastic view behind you of Notre Dom this is probably one of the best new photo spots that I'd never knew existed so Shakespearean companies cafes in my guide get a coffee there come here get a photo super workday speed which it is coffee time [Music] Shakespeare eco by the way in case you didn't know is a famous English bookstore here in Paris it's been here for a long time although I guess it moved it used to be in a different location when furnished anything I live here they don't allow photos inside and they're not even open yet so I'm just gonna get coffee next door if you want to check it out it's really really worth it I did film a little bit inside when Natasha had her reading I'll try to figure out where that one was but if you want to see a little bit there's ice I did sneak a little bit of fish man well that was a tasty cup of joe I did not however get anything to eat because one of the new additions to this neighborhood that is fantastic but I'm not a number centuries in my guide so I want to make sure I cover it just so you know that it's here it's called Circus it is delicious they been around for a while but their bakeries so good I'm gonna be tempted to get a second coffee but I'm not gonna do it because that would just be silly [Music] Circus is pretty amazing ah they've got a lot of really good sourdough offerings too if you're into stardom I don't like sourdough but I really like what they have so maybe I do like so I don't know maybe just never had good sourdough before I'll never know any of them in the meantime I'm gonna bounce over almost to the other end of this neighborhood very quickly show you Jardin des Plantes if you want to see it in more detail I just filmed there with Ellen am not that long ago we did a photo shoot there so if you'd like to see it in you know it's full glory with all kinds of flowering trees and things like that it always has different things that are flowering so you're not gonna miss out on that if you come and see it because it is just loaded with flowers and plants John and a plant who moved out I'm gonna finally sate my bond me craving with the best and cheapest bond me that I've found in town so far and I'm hoping to end at the pantheon we'll see how this goes [Music] I actually asked for permission to do this for those of you that asked if you should be able to speak French before you come to France it helps it really helps to be able to speak some French but I asked the guards at the front if I could real for just a second because I explained why and they were like okay for just a minute so to respect that I'm gonna get out of here but I thought I'd show you just a little bit of the park it's a fantastic fantastic part draw them they plants somebody's always flowering here something's always changing and there are tons of park benches to come sit have a picnic and there's a lot to explore including a zoo in here there's a zoo in here it's fantastic so make sure that you take advantage of it while you're here Jardin des Plantes I didn't even come in here the first time I lived here I'm pretty sure that was a mistake come hide from the urban environment for a minute enjoy some beautiful flowers and then you know bounce on out for lunch which we're going to sort of do let's let's head towards removed [Music] and don't forget the Grand Mosque is on the way as well if you feel like going in antastic only a few euros and just the gardens and the spaces in there are gorgeous also in that video with LNM ooh fresh space invaders it's a space invader with a fez I don't have that this is gonna be my 499 space invader I almost have 500 today could be the day today could be the day I'm so glad that I decided to explore over here a little bit instead of taking the easy route for 99 [Music] time to turn rent on remove hard enough despite it's ridiculous and borderline inappropriate sounding name remove tard is a fantastic spot for a little bit shopping food nightlife there's a bowling alley up here which I mean I never I've never gone bowling in Paris but I guess there's got to be at first sometime a couple of good coffee shops I'm about to pass dough's on the right which is a good one there's also what is reputed to be the best crepe in Paris I haven't had all the crepes so I can't tell you but one of the best crepes in Paris on my left which is in my guide dough's I'll give that one to you if you want to figure out what the best crepe in Paris is it's in my guide feel free to buy it there's a link below I also completely forgot to fill in what a 20 and 20 is just in case you're tuning in right now obviously you go back to the beginning you'll find out but a 20 and 20 this is a modified version of a drinking game where instead of having one drink in each or on his mother of course of one day I am doing one video in each around his mouth over the course of 20 days oh and here's some fantastic there okay I got to come back to this but basically I'm not just riding through all these indrani's months for the pure joy of it I'm also doing it so that you can see a little taste of each and every around his mom over the course of basically three weeks however rude you put the fair or the street of the iron pot is another fantastic spot for some food and also one of my favorite tap houses in the entire city if you want a great beer brew Barry I'll show you I'm assuming they're still open in spite of the construction going on above them at least they've got no signs saying they're closed this is a fantastic fantastic Tap House and across the street is their calves or their like beer cellar so they've got tons and tons of different beers in there as well I love this spot the Tap House versus cellar differentiation is really important though because they had a date here once and it almost was ruined by the fact that she was across the street and I was over here so you know be aware if you ask somebody to meet you here they're there you got to be clear which side you're on I think that we're a little bit early for lunch so we might just go straight to the Pantheon from here but of course we got to go to the scenic way [Music] and of course at the top of who moved a few have blasted a contrast gap which is also just kind of fun to sit I I can't like personally recommend any of the restaurants on this square cuz I don't know any that I would particularly like put an emphasis on but it is a great spot to sit people watch a little bit grab a gelato is fun when it's full of people as you might have noticed from this series first thing in the morning nothing in Paris is full of people just kind of the reason why I'm getting out first thing in the morning this is also my guy as a location recommendation more than like a specific food recommendation the meantime I want to go faster I've never gone up that street before [Music] pretty sure do you have this one but I got a double check it could be my 500th I don't think it will be 99% sure I have it but now I'm gonna be flashing like everything I pass just to be sure I didn't have that one that's my 500th I just got my 500 then Bader hundred of that congratulations to me that's like a personal it's well obviously everyone I get is a personal record that doesn't matter yeah I've leveled up in the worlds of nerd dumb okay it's been years probably five or six years since I've been inside the Pantheon combat but let's continue this talk somewhere more scenic the Pantheon originally built to be a church here in Paris and is now the burial grounds for the best and brightest of the city I have not been inside in probably six years they were doing some work on the pendulum at the time and what I've seen amid some good progress in that hopefully it's finished it does cost money to go inside which is why I've been saving it for this very day so today's the day that we head into the pantheon justice check it out and then from there I think we'll be ready for lunch not that I'm like excited about the bond meter I've been I've been thinking about this bond me ever since the first time I had it I'm really really excited for it [Music] no wheels allowed which comes as really no surprise but still unfortunate I'm gonna head to Trez Tech today I gotta leave the fifth to go leave my wheel with some friends they're great if you haven't been to Trez yet for a drink I'm gonna head there tomorrow cuz I got a film there tomorrow of course but they make some delicious cocktails and a fantastic brunch offering and hopefully they'll be nice enough to hold on to my wheel for me for a minute and away a weed yeah look at their adorable little Terrace so nice I like these guys a lot they're really friendly I'm gonna okay hopefully they'll let me store my wheel here for a minute success show us some love you come to the Pantheon afterwards or maybe before grab brunch a drink it's fantastic spot and in the afternoon I know it's in shadow now but in the afternoon you get a lot of Sun on the patio just set out here look at the garden from across the street and you're set anywho we're cheating because we're technically in the sixth let's get back to the fifth walking is so slow this is lame how long my wheel bihac [Music] the pendulum Foucault is actually really cool because the whole idea was to prove that the Earth revolves around itself and what's interesting is it appears over the course of the day they reset the pendulum at 10 o'clock and then let it go and it swings on the same plane the entire day and it appears to have rotated over the course of time but in reality it's still swinging on the same plane it's the earth that's rotated underneath it and that's what gives them the ability to tell time as the Earth rotates it's really really neat this place is beautiful it's fascinating it's really special it's gone back and forth between being a church and basically a temple to the Great's of France multiple times there currently is dedicated to France which you'll see and all the monuments that are in here now the one thing I got to find out is whether or not I can go all the way to the top because somebody told me that you can go all the way up once and I want if that's true I want to go up [Music] it was the tallest structure definitely in Paris 7-eleven France until they built the Eiffel Tower so there's a fair number stairs we didn't go over the top I was really hoping to get a view from the outside like go off the outside ring you may not be out of luck it continues I keep you posted it costs an extra three years to get up here so make sure you buy the additional three year ticket if you want to climb up and then they bring you up in groups [Music] all right yeah totally worth the three euros can you imagine living there Liat like on that rooftop right right in front of us with like the different like chairs and stuff set up then we exited in the far corner that was totally worth the extra three bucks been nine euros to get in here it's a bit overpriced but in the end worth it for that people holy smokes fortunately I'm struggling for battery life on the main camera so probably gonna have to come back at some point and get some better time lapses Spence I'm out of here go see tension pneumo reclaim my wheel and get some bonhomie and right around the corner from the Pantheon like I said it's it intentional my third favorite Church in the city and while no Saddam is closed it'll be my second favorite Church for visits in the city it's asymmetrical gorgeous on the inside you've seen it in a couple of my live streams spin around definitely been present in a number of my videos super worth it let's go check it out and then [Music] I love this church so much definitely my like I said third favorite Church in the whole city but just generally amazing building okay we've almost finished the fifth four it's a day at least there's so much where you could see this neighborhood is just a fun one to wander around if you'd like to grab a drink you can of course go next door to Tess who have been holding onto my wheel for me but there's the bum but you're right here as well if you want a pub also my guide if you haven't picked up on the fact I'm kind of pushing my guide right now if you'd like to download a copy there's a link below you can grab it for 20 bucks has like 200 plus recommendations all over the city along with a number of essays on how to get around where to stay how to avoid scams all that good stuff being a good stuff bonhomie time there closes until the 9th of May for renovations Daniel I wouldn't wanting this bond me forever okay well guess we'll have to come back in man end up ruining the place next door I'm just good as the other one but he'll do nice to spend some time on the left bank today always feels a little bit more chill to me than the right thing how do they like the set it's true even though I don't spend a lot of time on this side I think that's gonna do it for me on to 2020 sorry about the wind yeah it's gonna do it for me on the 20 and 20 today this has been the fifth of Paris if you want to show up tomorrow I'll be doing the 6th and I'm gonna post if you haven't looked already I'm gonna go ahead and post where the meetup is from others and meet up tomorrow cuz I don't know how many people are figuring out through the game and uh yeah we might have to change that mechanic sooner than later I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for another wonderful beautiful day in Paris and if you're in Paris hoping come out have a drink see you rock [Music] you
