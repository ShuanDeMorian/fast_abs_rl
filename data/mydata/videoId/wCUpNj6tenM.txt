 on crab on a passive middle vlog or jobless a holiday a meal good morning and welcome to day 6 of my 20 and 20 20 and 20 each round is not done in 20 days basically there are 20 around these months or districts in Paris and I'm hitting each one and with a different video every day for basically three weeks today I'm in the shakes I'm gonna start by cheating a little bit I'm gonna go to a coffee shop that is technically in the seventh but is on the border with the sixth st. pearl it's very nice kind of tiny but delicious with coffee comes great power and with great power comes the ability to go to the rest of the year honest [Music] now the reason that I ended up including this and my guide in the 6th was partially because when we first found it thought it was in the six didn't realize was technically in the seventh and second because the sixth doesn't have a lot for good coffee they have a lot of famous coffee they didn't go pro cup cafe broke up cafe being where coffee was actually introduced to the city but they're not really places I would go to get a cup of coffee they're kind of more for the historical experience in perspective than for the you know caffeination experience or perspective so started at Saint pearl we're gonna go straight to a church that I've never been into before and I'm gonna try to get into now the abbey of central Monday pit which was originally basically its own village that had tax-exempt status and that's why everybody wanted to live in it until they were like okay this is over into our the walls down that's like a very basic summation of the history of it but we're gonna pass caf√© de Flore they do my go I will of course show this to you there in my guy because he should go you can't miss out on them but they're kind of like a one and done type of experience and only if you're in it for like the historical significance not necessarily for the you know deliciousness and price point [Music] as a beautiful church I had no idea they had that kind of styling on the inside I'm gonna wait till I get off these cobblestones to keep talking the style on the inside reminds me of snot Chapelle actually with the blue and the gold it was very beautiful highly recommended quick visit obviously undergoing some renovations but it's really nice one more church that I haven't been in in a really long time social peace which is not far away it's kind of like a big well I'll show you south so peace is fantastic for more than being a church I think the best part of this place is the fountain which is on it's a good sign that spring is officially here when the fountains are getting turned on around town this fountain with his giant lightens is iconic in and of itself the church is kind of interesting the way that I look at it is very much like um kind of a simplistic take on a church it's almost like Roman giant's built it the detail work isn't as intricate and doesn't start until higher up it just kind of makes me think that there are Berlocq really big people who didn't really care what was happening down at the level of their feet that wound up building this thing [Music] very nice and they're very lofty it's not my favorite church the detail work there's not as much stained glass I just don't think it's quite as impressive but it's nice very different from the abbey that that was cool for somebody that's today's little person I've ever gone inside the abbey now of course we're very close and have to head towards Jardin de Luxembourg where the gardens of Luxembourg which are phenomenal but before we actually go in I have to do two things one explore a little bit to see if I can find any space invaders and to pop by treads to get another snack it may be a fresh juice or something both sound great [Music] I already have all the ones around here wondering I pop out a little farther away from the park maybe I'll find one oh I'm gonna show you a really great spot for a course on as well it's my video on the five best panel Chocolat in the city but everything they make is really good and they're not far from here so I'm just going to swing by there show it to you and then we'll head to tres [Music] Bread and Roses in my guide in other at least one other video that I've made super worth it if you happen to be staying in the neighborhood come get your pastries on first thing in the morning they bake them fresh and they don't make a ton of them so if you come and you miss them you'll have to wait to the afternoon for the second batch I only know this from personal experience because they came and I think it was when I was actually making a bit about panacek a lot I had to like go shooting Jardin de Luxembourg while I waited for them to actually bake the next batch I totally just betrayed my intention to go farther from the park by coming back to the park this was a mistake I really want to go in but I don't want to take my wheel let's go to Trez grab a snack and juice something like that does provide really really great cocktails which is why we're gonna be having the meetup there later this evening and there in the game Fiona ware of the game the game is on travel on ma comm travel unlock comm is where you'll find the rules you can download the riddles the riddles are available now you can find everything you need to come and play the game and basically it's a treasure hunt around town where you go you collect stickers those stickers are worth points the riddles are also worth points if you correctly solve them let me know how hard they are I think some of them might be really difficult hopefully some of them aren't too hard but as you go around town basically you go into different way points that will give you stickers they might give you a little bit of a bonus while you're there and many of them will be able to help you with some of the riddles as you go as well and then at the end you can go to one of the two base locations and turn in all your points for postcards if you needed any postcards for your trip a good way to do it I'm gonna finish up the beta here soon but you can also fill out a beta survey get some extra points and my patrons also have a bonus riddle that gives them some extra points as well so don't miss out [Music] heizo Char Dham these guys were right across from the garden of Luxembourg which is what I'm gonna pay them a visit before I go in grab myself a snack they're great and they were my wheel babysitters yesterday when I went into the pantheon if you'll remember so double thanks to them cuz they're just fantastic in the afternoon this patio behind me is bathed in sunlight so it's a fantastic place to come sit have a nice cold drink stare at the gardens across the way and then go visit the gardens or come after you visit the gardens or do both can I have a cold brew coffee Maya you may have cool it yes this is their first batch of cold brew coffee I'm super excited ooh and my feet Li the break is the perfect timing [Music] this is exactly what I needed the weather just got hot today too so this is perfect perfect timing mmm I also want some cake or something [Music] you guys are letting me have what so what is this yogurt drink called again keep you here it's a homemade soda made with yogurt stuff I don't understand it but it's still hishis oh they make it you guys make this in-house right yeah make everything here so I just love coming in here [Music] M&N apple crumble in a really long time so good and it's gluten-free they have a vegan option and a gluten-free option and lots of vegan options oh it's like one of my favorite desserts in the world and it's hard to find it's delicious I'm also like bouncing because of that cold brew whoa not only is it delicious it's really really strong let's check out Jardin de Luxembourg I got two more things I want to show you today there's actually one place I really wanted to go today that I'm not gonna make it to I'm under the gun because construction guy that was supposed to come to my apartment yesterday postponed on me and is coming this afternoon so I rushed through yesterday I'm rushing through today hopefully he actually shows up today not a pattern I'd like to maintain we'll be back at treads this evening for the Meetup once again walking sucks I'd much rather be on my wheel right now but the Jardin de Luxembourg is gorgeous it's huge the palace of Luxembourg was built for the mother of louis xiii and then expanded upon after the monarchy was knocked over and they built it up to be the senate so this is where the french senate is act so the palace itself not super accessible but the garden is definitely accessible and well worth a visit especially if you've got a picnic lunch and you're ready to come and sit tons of benches tons of chairs super super worth it [Music] I absolutely love this part time to reclaim the wheel zip towards saw Michel there's a lot more you could discover in this or on these month there's a lot of amazing stuff it's also one of the ones I highly recommend you stay in if you're gonna stay in Paris and of course if you want to know more details about where and why I recommend you stay in Paris check out my guide link below I hope you're not getting tired of me saying that but it's it's full of good information so let's bounce down towards the river alright can't wait to come back here later Hamish to meet up I'm gonna have one of they've got this really good bourbon cocktail that it's been in my vlog before I don't even remember what it's called but they'll know and it'll be delicious meantime ooh I'm not gonna go this way because that looks like a traffic jam let's divert Hugh turn time we're gonna show you pleso Michel and then I think that is a wrap for the six like I said there's tons more you could see lots of places that I opted not to go that I really want to go but time limits so I suppose we'll just have to come back and visit again sometime sounds rough and of course I don't want to forget that the 43 one of my favorite rooftop Bars in the entire city is right next to the plateau me show as well couldn't let that go I got a few roots up Partizan my guide some pretty handy ones that's definitely one of them oh there's their delight [Music] that's let me show well this is the funtendo semi show that's let me show kind of extends back there where you saw some of those tables and so forth it's a walking district of course if we cross over there we'll end up back in the fifth which is where there's a lot more walking district type food some of its good some of its super touristy a lot of its overpriced but it's still a really fun place to come walk find something to eat stroll down to the river it's great this fountain not on yet but will be on soon has Saint Michael on it's why the place is called Sami show Saint Michael the Archangel and that my friends is a fairly comprehensive tour of the sixth could have been deeper could have been longer but you know you can't hit it all in one go I'm gonna go ahead and go I got to do this construction thing and deal with that and then amia tonight might throw in some footage from the meetup but I might just leave it here in that case I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for another round of the 20 and 20 this time in Paris's seventh arrondissement which is famous for its most famous monument and the breakfast burritos aren't bad either see then [Music]
