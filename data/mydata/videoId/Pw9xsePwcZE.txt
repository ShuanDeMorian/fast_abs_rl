 today is vlog day 1014 [Music] [Music] good morning and welcome to day 14 of my 20 and 20 in Paris to be spent in the underrated 14th it's underrated I don't know I'm just trying to be generous to it this not a lot to do in the 14th there's a surprise today though hexagon one of the local Roasters here in Paris actually has their own coffee shop in the 14th which plugs a hole for me in the 14th because I didn't think there is any good coffee in the port team we're gonna go prove that wrong right now and demonstrate that the 14th truly is underrated and after that there's not a lot to see or do it's a very big around yzma doesn't have a lot going on the one thing it would have going on catacombs which maybe will wander by but as I found out when I went online to try to buy tickets the other day is sold out into next week so if you're going to go to the catacombs learn from me buy your tickets well in advance online because there's not a guarantee you're gonna be able to get in but that's ok we'll make a whole video about that some other time today I'm gonna grab coffee and then just go for a stroll through the 14th may be doing an invader hunt Laura said she wanted to join me and try to find some invaders so we'll try to go and find some invaders as we go see what we can suss out hopefully up those points because I'm closing in on tribe a team if you know Paul from the peloton his family is leading the pack and total number of invaders found and I'm closing that gap and today if we do a good job of it could be the day that I take the crown away from them so let's see how that goes I'm gonna go ahead and grab a coffee here let's find Xing on it should be around here somewhere and then we'll continue on from there [Music] in a long and tiring week no wife I had to see you know if you ever come to exa gan and the space invader that looks like my space invader is not a real space invader they can't all be real anyway we're gonna go walk and see what the 14th has to offer which is largely I think going to be tranquility their coffee is as good as I've had it elsewhere it's nice to go and get it served straight from them I don't know where they do their roasting but it's exciting to see more and more Roasters in Paris and I hope that they start taking taken on the worlds just like we're gonna take on the fourteenth huzzah I got nothing I'm so tired [Music] [Music] so we just learned from Roux the Irish gravekeeper what you call somebody works in a in a graveyard groundskeeper I suppose he's a groundskeeper he's a tombs keeper this is a windmill this is the old windmill back when these were farms that's where they used to grind the wheat and everything into flour after Napoleon first started killing lots of people this is where they first buried somebody and turned it into a cemetery when it was outside of Paris when it was south of the city which remember of the bigger cemeteries in the city are actually or were actually started when they were outside the city keep all those dead people away and now the living have moved out to live around them that's my whole story anyways we're gonna go see another very famous tomb sort of the catacombs just to show you not that we can't go in today like I said but after that walk down to see Parc Monceau via another park I've never seen before and just taken advantage of exploring the 14th because don't spend any time here pretty much ever [Music] he's actually ever been [Music] that is not an insignificant line to get into the catacombs I'm actually glad we're not going in there today I'm not gonna lie from here I'm gonna walk to Matsui which is a park I've never been to take a stroll through that we have found zero space invaders so far wildly disappointing I figured there should be some around here near the catacombs right boo [Music] oh come on and killing me the day has not lost her hey hey [Music] if it wasn't for all the construction this little Boulevard leading up to the park could be really nice we are walking uphill lots of stairs going up to the little Hills just like there'd be a lot to explore here few space invaders which is good feeling a little bit better about the world now see how this part goes might check out the petite Sun sure John is supposed to John is supposed to be joining us as well well see if he does crazy Birds I'm just angry birds and yeah that's a nice job day walking through the through the 14th it's like a big park full of residential areas and entries I guess [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but this park is nice Parc Monceau of a it's a little bit underwhelming it's not like one of the most fanciest biggest coolest parks in the city but if you're in the 14th definitely worth a visit come have a picnic stay away from the Cougar and the snakes that's scary and yeah we're gonna go check out jisang show right now just something that I've always wanted to look at I was planning on looking at tomorrow in the 15th as well but I'll explain when we get there [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] poteete caveat i don't know actually which sections of the petite ceinture are open feel like there are a couple around the city and depending on the time but as you can tell from the graffiti down there it is accessible even if it's not open so I'm not I'm not suggesting you do anything but I'm just saying you know anyways we'll stroll along a little bit more of it maybe there's some that is open there's supposed to be something else around here I'm not sure and then lunch we're thinking today could be the the street food lunch day just something cheap and tasty because I don't have any recommendations down here personally maybe we'll find something also these modern buildings like pick this one feels like we're in Chicago it doesn't feel like we're in Paris whatsoever [Music] [Applause] [Music] so it's not some people down on the railway really maybe we can't get down there but all the public gardens are locked and then there's this stairwell right here that leads down to it just walk over you figure out to get done but this is the stairs down sympathy block on Caleb petite ceinture oh no step abuja album we'll call it up they said that normally it's open but their colleague walks to the door so he locked us out but it closes at 5:00 p.m. is what they just told us so we made it we simply snuck in but yeah by asking some workers to let us in basically I see no space invaders yet but there's a lot of camouflage here so we'll see what we find [Music] it looks like this section is open for like at least a kilometer maybe more I'm not sure normally I'd want to walk and explore this but considering that my legs are shot from the last two weeks of walking around Paris and wheeling around Paris I think it's lunchtime but we made it down here really cool I feel like that's cheating though if you like let's go at least go through here [Applause] [Music] battery's about to die I'm gonna go ahead and drop it off here we're gonna grab lunch in a second and then I will film lunch with my phone if nothing else and I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for day 15 of the 20 and 20 in Paris wandering around seeing random sights walking on the petite ceinture you never know what's gonna happen tomorrow might be just as unique I'll see you tomorrow for that [Music]
