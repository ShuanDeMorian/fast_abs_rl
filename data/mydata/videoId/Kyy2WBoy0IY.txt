 today's blog day 1016 [Music] good morning and welcome to day 16 of my 20 and 20 here in Paris or fittingly or in the 16th the 16th arrondissement of Paris is a large one it is one of the more famously wealthy ones it's beautiful it's quiet there's not a lot going on as far as food that I would recommend or coffee that I would recommend but it does have a corner on one industry and that is embassies I was gonna say museums but there are museums all over the city they do have some fantastic museums however including this one I'm wheeling around a little bit within the recently finished square of palais de tokyo palais de tokyo being home to one of the modern art museums here in paris with some fantastic exhibitions often and yeah this is a really nice little it's not even a fountain really i guess it's more of just kind of like a stagnant pond but it is a nice little stagnant pond they do have a little cafe here that you can sit at if you'd like to although it's pretty hard to see the Eiffel Tower from it because you know trees that said the 16th does offer some of the most famous views of the Eiffel Tower a few of which I will show you today and it does have one really good coffee shop which I'm gonna start making my way towards writing me out [Music] Laflamme de la libert√© or the replica flame from the Statue of Liberty that was a gift from New York to Paris is technically in the 8th so we're gonna pretend we didn't see that I'm gonna head up the hill here and of all of the museum's that you could see in the 16th I'm just gonna show you a few as we bounce past them some of which are prettier from the outside than others palais de tokyo which we're kind of looping around right now is not one that I would necessarily say is the prettiest the courtyard is nice it's fairly smooth too many stairs to really take advantage of on the wheel but it's nice the other side of it though and they got the modern part but not so much the art part on the exterior of this one it is the colonnade in the middle is fairly nice I do like that and you know the over it's fine I'm giving it a hard time it's a really great museum I shouldn't give it to art every time there are a few space invaders around here as well I don't want to show you too many of them because I mean the whole point is that you find them on your own but there are like four I think in the immediate vicinity of the palais de tokyo so you know that'll keep you busy and across the way although it's currently closed is the Palais de Galatea lots of power lots of Palace peleg Arrieta technically it's not supposed to be open for another hour so I don't know who opened that door but nice little peek inside this is a fashion museum far as I understand it I've never actually been inside but I have taken advantage of that Park it is real nice so definitely go on there for a picnic oh here's a great one of the nice things about doing this on a Sunday not only is the 16th usually you know pretty chill but it's Sunday so it's basically borderline dead right now which is fantastic for riding the wheel around but just to the right of palais de tokyo one of the views that i've shared before one of my favorite photos of the city especially we have a real camera is right here the eiffel tower in all of its glory framed delightfully above some very Parisian chimneys might as well take advantage of it while you're here one more museum that I'm going to show you right here as well as one awesome statue of American George Washington's statue in front of the Asian cultural and heritage museum which is a fantastic museum if he ever it's just it's a really good one [Music] [Music] now a combinations hey my eyes are gonna be watering because even though I'm not allergic the trees are dumping like enough palm that you can just feel it hit you in the face right up here around the corner are two less less famous museums the architectural Museum and the Museum of Man but they're nice museums and they do provide one of the more famous views of the Eiffel Tower probably be most famous to the Eiffel Tower which you've seen in tons of photos who've seen it in movies seen in the Mission Impossible movie of him and it's very worth the visit you've seen this in my video about photos to the Eiffel Tower as well as my video about photoshoots with L and M and the hot tip for this is if you want to get like actual photos of yourself here without a ton of people you got to get here early in the morning because even on a Sunday I mean that's not so bad there aren't a ton of people there already but you know it's almost 9:00 in the morning and people are already starting to show up which is fine they're all going to enjoy it they're all gonna appreciate it so much but they're also gonna make it pretty hard to get the photo of your dreams so you get here early peaking a photo of my dreams did you notice Benjamin Franklin amis [Applause] I'm sitting around just enjoying the wheel this morning and got pollen in the eye again the so annoying we're entering into a very famous shopping area well I don't know how famous it really is there's a Conda pistol you over here there's a lot of really big stuff there's a lot of big names lots of shopping it's not quite as famous as Victor Hugo though we get over to afternoo Victor Hugo there's even more upscale shopping like a ton of upscale shopping and we're gonna go that way because our coffee is in that direction let me wet - my understanding is another station formerly on the petite ceinture so if you remember from the 14th we went to the petite ceinture which is the original railroad ring around Paris and there's still a bunch of the old train stations up and available and what's really cool about the one that's over here that I'm on my way to show you as well as a couple other things is that it got converted into a bar slash restaurant now it's a really cool experience when you go in there it's been under construction for a long time so I don't know when it's gonna open again however when it does open highly worth it just for the environment like it's really cool to go sit the French do really cool things with old train stations and this is no exception however in my experience in the past the service has been pretty terrible and everything has been generally overpriced but that's the problem with the 16th is the 16th being one of the wealthier neighborhoods is also all very consistently overpriced and you know generally the food options aren't the kind of food and drink options that I would be interested in and tend to be a little bit less interesting there they just put it that way but we're in an area called pecci which is also the name of the metro station as you'll remember from yesterday and the MIT is the metro station that you would jump on that over to beer it came to get that fantastic shot of the Eiffel Tower as you go across the river on Line six here's the grand of history that I was talking about a minute ago so pecci let me wet sorry my geography about this area is not the best but pastula ooh there's a space invader Pasi a la Muette are ya pretty decently upscale shopping areas you'll find a lot of what you're looking for here if you're a shopper but Avenue Victor Hugo is even more intense for that I don't know if I this one looks familiar if you like I have it but let's be sure [Music] yeah I had that one already but this is lag are theoretically its opening in April of 2019 so we'll see if that's true but you'll see a number of buildings like this around the city this is actually if you look for one of these old train stations that's how we got into the petite ceinture the other day in the 14th so that's how you can find your way in hopefully this is on the petite ceinture but it's it's it's kind of a different version of it and there's a park back here I want to show you as well as a Monet Museum yeah and that's it then I want to go get coffee [Music] [Applause] so here on the back side of the park is the marmatan Monet museum if you want to come see some Monet's along with I don't know all kinds of other stuff I'm not actually sure what all's in here there's your opportunity all right there there's one cool shot over here that I've never really noticed that the lines worked out of the Eiffel Tower and then the much-awaited coffee the place I'm going to take you to is one of the only places if it's the only place in the 16th that I've found so far which is great because it plugs that hole for me I suppose but it's called you decide very good to make everything in-house really nice they're not a coffee roaster of their own but they serve the barn which is a fantastic coffee roaster that you might recognize from my trip to Berlin and how do I get down from here this isn't it doesn't go down far enough right put it and yeah I'm ready [Music] so just on the other side of these embassies and the traffic over here you'll find the Bois de Boulogne the butter blown the woods of bolon are technically on the outside of the periphery so they should be outside of Paris but they've been annexed by the sixteenth much like the Bois de Vincennes has been annexed by the 12th Paris likes to add parks to its ranks whenever it can so so when you look at a map instead of Paris kind of globbing on like the map that I show at the beginning of each of these kind of extends out to the left and the right a little bit as well don't worry we'll go check that out after coffee but first coffee there are a couple of things out there that we could check out one is the Hippodrome which we're not going to go check out probably because it's on one far into broader blown and bottle blown huge the other is the louis vuitton foundation which is what i wanted to go check out because it actually never gone out and seen it the Hippodrome is where you can go to watch horse races not gonna be that interesting to see from the outside so that's why I'm not so worried about it but the Louis Vuitton foundation should be very interesting to see from the outside don't think they're gonna let me bring my wheel in but that's okay I haven't been going into any museums or anything on this whole thing really so we'll save that for another time but you know we're not gonna save for another time that I keep talking about that I keep not doing anything about but I'm gonna do something about now coffee [Music] [Music] my whole day is ruined why well that's the worst how the unfortunate there is one saving grace though if you want you oh hey is a great bakery it's in my list of chains that'll save you if you're a desperate need of pastries at least coffee not really gonna recommend it necessarily but I've already I guess I could at least get a pastry here to hold me over I remember [Music] [Applause] [Music] kind of shocked a lot to hold me over and I realize how cold my hands were until I tried to take money out of my wallet I'm cold it's kind of fumbling around a little bit I might commit another sin I don't really want like a bistro espresso I've been at Starbucks in about I think like two or three months it seems like I'm due for my quarterly Starbucks experience I find Starbucks to be kind of like 30% of the time it's good and then like the rest of time it's kind of like something something's weird so hopefully today is a 30% positive day and then I got three more things to talk about to to show you I think we'll find out [Music] well they got my drink rung but you know cool this Starbucks did actually save my life at one point though years ago when I was in desperate need of Wi-Fi and actually in the middle of a transition between living in West Africa well Central Africa at the time and moving back to the states and I was doing some training for a job I needed the internet didn't have access to it and spent a lot of that time in that Starbucks studying that was like five or six years ago something like that so you know I owe that to them that was very nice of them they can get my drink wrong every once in a while it's okay in here this is the roundabout in Victor Hugo square or the plastic picture you go like I said lots and lots of shopping here but what we're interested in who is one of these side streets gonna show you a nice shot of the Arc de Triomphe as well as a very famous Street one of the things that the 16th is famous for is its awesome ending architecture there's a lot of us men in architecture up here feels very classically Parisian and it has really wide sidewalks which are fantastic for riding wheels this right here is Avenue to fall Avenue fall is a really nice big Boulevard wonderful view of the Arc de Triomphe a little bit of dark World War two history and you can look up but yeah not sure I'd really come up here for a stroll on its own but does make for some nice shots [Music] in all honesty we would have gotten a better shot of the Arc de Triomphe from Avenue Victor Hugo if we kept going that way so might have to hit that up on the way back but we're on our way to Bois de Boulogne which if we were to go left and go way left we can make it all the way down to the lakes the Hippodrome and beyond that Park deep constant park deposit is a sporting complex basically there's football rugby if you're interested in seeing that you can see the time that poor Sean and I win watched a PSG football match but it's a long ways away I made a video about that already you can go check that out in the meantime I'm gonna go right check out the Louie Vuitton foundation for the first time and then we'll swing back around see if we can't get ourselves a better photo of the Arc de Triomphe and maybe just maybe from there we'll call it a day I'm not even I'm not even sure what to do for lunch around here to be honest especially on a Sunday [Music] during the day the Bois de Boulogne is actually really nice I didn't realize some of this some of these three streets are actually really big you can go for walks through here runs there's a restaurant in the middle of a tiny lake in here like there's a lot of interesting things to discover but I wouldn't stay too late there's definitely a curfew here because it's a big park it doesn't get closed off like all the other parks inside of Paris so it gets used for more nefarious purposes at night and yeah I just wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't wander in here at her after dusk but we're here early in the morning on a Sunday so everything should be nice and friendly know what we're gonna do is we're actually gonna take a left here and I'm hoping that we should be able to see that we've its own foundation here fairly soon very interested in this thing for those of you with kids there is an amusement park out here I don't know if it's big enough amusement park that adults would find it particularly entertaining but you know it's got leopards all over it so it must be awesome might have to try it out one of these days just to see what it's like in the meantime I think we're on the verge of hitting up the Louie Vuitton foundation finally [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] after sitting here for a while I have mixed feelings about this thing I'll report in uh I'll give it I'll give it a couple minutes [Music] the curvature of the exterior is pretty satisfying at first I wasn't really a big fan of the material and I also thought I'd be a lot bigger I thought it would actually be about double this size that it is but aside from that it looks pretty cool from the outside I definitely want to go in and check it out might have to come make a video about it one of these days but in the meantime you know it's kind of cool just to see from the outside and it does look like the spaces that they've created below with the water are also really neat [Music] oh this has been a wonderful morning bouncing around the 16th the Louie Vuitton foundation definitely worth checking out I have a feeling I'm looking I'm really looking forward to going and paying it some real attention as for this amusement park I did hear people screaming so you know either it's fun or people are dying who knows it could be a combination of the two I'm gonna head over to Victor Hugo one more time just to see if I can't get myself a good photo of the Arc de Triomphe from the 16th I hope you've enjoyed this wander through the 16th with me this morning I've been reminded and pushed by some patrons recently to ask you to like the video if you enjoyed it this morning and like every video if you enjoy them as you go feel free to leave a comment and if you haven't subscribed yet please do subscribe and also while I'm asking you to do too many things all at once if you haven't followed me over on Instagram yet I'm really hoping that you'll follow me over there for two reasons one if we cross over the 30 thousand subscriber mark on YouTube here in the next week or so I'll be doing a Q&A over there through my Instagram stories and oh this is quite the cluster here that the traffic cluster yikes gotta watch out for good drivers what was I saying before those guys decided to be terrible at driving oh yeah if you follow me over on Instagram I'll do a Q&A through my Instagram stories so if you've got any cues for me I've got the A's make sure to jump in on that and the other reason my ulterior motive is I really want to get past 10,000 followers over on Instagram just so I can do the swipe up thing like I really want in my stories I want to be able to link to stuff I've always wanted to do that it won't let me do that until I get to 10,000 so if you want to help me out there that would be great I'm gonna go grab a photo of the Arc de Triomphe now and I will see you bright and early tomorrow morning for twenty and twenty day seventeen in the 17th arrondissement and I'm sure it'll be a glorious time as well hope you enjoyed the 16th I'll see you tomorrow bye [Music] [Applause] [Music]
