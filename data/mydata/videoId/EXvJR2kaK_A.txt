 promoting 1015 I just want to say to all the haters out there why [Music] [Applause] [Music] morning and welcome to day 15 of my 20 and 20 I was about to say 15 and 15 not getting off that easy today we're gonna be doing the fifteenth around his Mountain crest which is famous for not a whole lot actually it is often misconstrued as being the one with the Eiffel Tower in it because you can see that for tower next to it which is what the first thing I'm going to show you today is we're taking a particular Metro route today to show you a very famous shot that you too can accomplish if you just take behind 6:00 from pesi to there the game now the trick is to make sure that you get a seat with a window if you can obviously shoot through the doors that's fine but if you can get a seat with windows pull the windows down you're gonna be going from pecci to beer Hakeem and you want to be on the left-hand side of the Train the better shot is coming from being a team to Class C here a team's actually in the 15th then you could be on the par said you'd make sure that there's no train that goes between you and the tower but that's this video [Music] [Applause] [Music] there's no shame in going back and forth on this lineup if you want to get multiple shots don't worry about it also congratulations to Sean for getting a thousand subscribers but if you haven't subscribed to Bhushan yet you should go do that right now thank you if you go now go jump on it I'm gonna link to it and we're making something together as well so you catch that when you post a fight which I got is thousand subscriber video it's great now we're down in the bowels of the RERC actually we're nowhere near the bowels at this point it gets even more Bali than this but we're on our way out to the balloon generality this is one of the great secrets of Paris that you might see it from the distance while you're here but there is a hot-air balloon their website claims it as the biggest hot-air balloon in the world anyways if you jump where's this coming from and why is this happening to me if we're gonna jump on our ERC and had just a few stops towards Versailles to try the balloon the thing about the balloon is that it's very weather sensitive they use it for air pollution testing and they do let people go up in it but only when the weather is very favorable if there's wind and I think rain they don't send it up so there's a chance we're gonna get there just to be turned away but worth giving it a try especially considering how the weather looks right now if we do great if we don't that just means we get coffee faster [Music] [Applause] we're on the wrong side forgot entirely bit there we'll show you later there's a Statue of Liberty that you can see you as you leave the city you're not even leaving the city technically you see [Music] I guess so it's not looking good for balloon ride the lights are on this thing right now but don't see any people think that that booth over there might be where the tickets are sold you can buy the tickets online as well you just didn't do that because since our odds were so low that we'd be going up and also because we'd be getting here early enough no just buy them in person but look at the fun the fun car lights [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] Santos there yeah my skin is too dark we're dis we're doing we're doing the virtual experience because the the real balloon experience is currently unavailable until Monday because of the weather yeah kepta hold you you guys how do I look well that would have been a lovely experience oh yeah that's much windier than when we went in the VR experience definitely a nice taster for what someday we will get to enjoy in person I'm sure but she was really nice she was best customer service in Paris right there [Music] [Music] we caught a space invader before catching the metro now it's time for good news coffee good news coffee by the way in the game if you're playing the game make sure to go get your stickers from them I'm just getting coffee ooh and they're double choc the cookies yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and the microphone out seriously I was trying to say you have to get the triple chocolate cookie it's the most delicious we're gonna go see the park here I exchanged Bhushan for Kate or caper Bhushan I don't know actually what the order of that is grammatically and kafir Bhushan and we're gonna go check out this park and then there are two more things in the fifteenth I really wanted to highlight and we'll see what we discover along the way [Music] unfortunately the fountain is not on this is a really nice little park they're pretty does not look sports friendly necessarily but definitely picnic worthy on to the next thing [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're in a government press which is one of the main train stations in the city I did not bring you here to see the train station but the Tower of Montparnasse which is as many have described it the box the Eiffel Tower came in not particularly well-loved in the city does have a really nice observation deck which I will link to over here I made a video about views in Paris or views of Paris and it is one of the better views of Paris in the sense that you can see the Eiffel Tower and it's interesting and you can't see the building bonus points but it is not a great view because it's too high in my opinion interview that you want to get of Paris needs to be closer to rooftop level you still want the Eiffel Tower to be above you and so it's not my favorite view of the city I think it's a little bit overrated which is why I will not be going up there today because I've already done it you can go see that if you want but we can at least come check it out and show you the area because the areas also got a lot of shopping lots of food movie theaters all kinds of stuff is very lively neighborhood [Music] yeah truck it's really good which cafe what's the name of it it's called dream cafe dream cafe yeah okay we can try a we can go over there we finally found some she'll Asian well they've been out here like every weekend for like two months yeah that's too many but yeah found found a little bit of the March and the cops are following and we're going the other way you can't recommends the Booya Chartier okay right by Torme I'm pronouncing the dream cafe where is it all right we'll go we'll go scope that out and then avoid that this is your after drink location yeah it's happy hour until 11:30 and they're only five year old cocktails and three year over here sounds like a winner of a happy hour [Music] alright we're dodging the the rest of the G legend here it was a very nice peaceful little walk ahead and going some music I don't know I'm gonna lose this one she's gotta go have lunch with a friend I'm gonna jump online ten and head back actually leaving the 15th right now gonna take the long way go back online ten and I want to show you one last site that a lot of people don't know is here and even the people that do know is here most people don't ever go see it so get your chance also I'm wearing my hat backwards because the wind blew it off and it seems like a safer safer routes I don't wanna go chasing my hat twice in one day [Music] this part of town is probably not so interesting for tourists but it is kind of interesting for people that live here at least on this side of town do you live in the 15th and maybe across the river in the sixteenth bull Grinnell is a nice little shopping area there's a really big mall over here as well as just kind of tons of just everyday shopping stuff whether it's buying a cell phone going to McDonald's doing your grocery shopping going to Defty to buy yourself a washing machine or a vacuum cleaner or something like that not an area that you really want to come and visit if you didn't live here but you know it's also not bad the one thing that you do want to see though that's very close here and the reason you might come here is just over here on the river let's go check it out [Music] [Music] the Statue of Liberty haha it's the biggest Statue of Liberty in town they're multiple around the city but that is the biggest if you find them all congratulations not only does this bridge take you to that and have this really nice long walkway all the way over to beer hakim which is the bridge we started the morning on which you'll see I'm gonna take a shot of it here at the Eiffel Tower but you have nice shots of that photographer here so lovely get the trains going back and forth across them it's great it's really windy out here today hopefully my fuzzy cat or dead cat is doing his job and making it possible to hear me and understand me but that is the 15 in a nutshell not a ton going on but up and coming with some really nice coffee shops a couple nice things to see and river access and Eiffel Tower shots so still highly worth it I hope you have a wonderful day wherever it is you are and I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for day 16 of my 20 and 20 see tomorrow [Music]
