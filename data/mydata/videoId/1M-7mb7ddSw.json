Obviously if you are worried about them yanking your visa if you say anything I can understand that but simply acknowledging it and saying that the city is doing well or banded together I do not think would jeopardize your status.  If someone were to watch this vlog three or four years from now they would have no idea the attack ever occurred sort of like doing a vlog about New York and never mentioning 911.  I also find it kind of disrespectful to the person or people that were killed that the rest of you guys in Paris totally ignored their loss while you drink coffee and take pictures of space invaders.  I will conclude with this and then I am going to unsubscribe. It seems to me the more money you make on patron and the better off you are doing the more shallow your vlog is becoming. I first came to your vlog because I kind of shared in your struggles of trying to transition and make a new life for myself however as I watch your vlogs now all it ever seems about is coffee, latte\u2019s, field trip\u2018s and merchandise.  I hope you find what you are looking for in life but I will leave you with a saying from the Bible  \u201cA double minded man is unstable in all his ways\u201d.",
