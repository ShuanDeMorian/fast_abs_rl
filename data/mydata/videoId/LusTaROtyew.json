At the present time, I am in Boise, Idaho and I noticed from one of your video that you are from Pullman, Washington north of here. Small world isn&#39;t it? You&#39;re like a Paris native since you know your way around the city so well. I haven&#39;t been back to Paris in years and it looks like it hasn&#39;t changed much except for the hordes of tourists. 27 million tourist a year!! Incroyable!!!",
