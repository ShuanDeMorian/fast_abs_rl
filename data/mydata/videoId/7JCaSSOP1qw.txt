gone to the museum we've had such yummy food it's gonna be such a short trip but I'm just gonna try to make every second count [Music] hey guys I have the most incredible story to tell you so basically what happened I was wearing these earrings today both of them and I realized that one of them was missing and obviously instantly I got upset forgiven now I'm still I'm just a little bit in shock because I was like oh my gosh these are one of my favorite earrings I love them and my darling husband like ran off and was like I'm gonna try find them and I'm like don't worry about it they're lost like who knows when you know they would have been lost and anyway we're taking some pictures so we looked on my phone and we realized there was a time where I still had them and I did it and he goes I think of its around in that area you head back to the hotel first and I'm like no no no no it's okay and when I was walking back to the hotel I was starting to feel really disheartened and I'm like oh my gosh I can't believe I lost one my favorite earrings and I was starting to feel really down and then I got in my room and then I was like you know what at the end of the day it's just an earring if worse comes to worse you could buy another one right you know I just actually just prayed a little prayer to God and I was like you know what I don't want to let this steal my joy the most important thing is that hobbies okay so just please let him get back to the hotel soon I don't care about any of like that I just I don't want let it affect our trip because yeah I'm here I'm so grateful to be here for our anniversary like anyway he came back in the room I know there's a long story it came back into the room and then he throws me this earring and he found it like I can't believe he found it it's like a needle in a haystack and the amazing thing is not only did he find it I've got the other one sitting there it was at night too and he he just sort of caught a little like glimmer at the side of the road where I had lost it crossing the bridge to the children's garden and I don't know how he found it and I don't know if you've ever had a story like that but it was like something that I thought that was lost is found and I don't know hobby hobby said he just felt a lot of peace when he was looking for he wasn't like stressing out he just I don't know and I'm just so shocked and I just think well like I didn't expect that and to have something to have it back again I'm I know it makes me appreciate it even more but what makes me appreciate the most is that his initial reaction like he just ran off and he wanted to find my earring for me and that to me is the most precious thing you know as I said to you this true pieces celebrate our 18 year wedding anniversary and I just feel so blessed and so lucky to be married to a man like him not just it's not even just this instance it's it's everything so I just wanted to share that with you guys good
