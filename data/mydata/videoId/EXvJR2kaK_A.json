But not too badly - I tend to be careful when I do.\n\nWhy are you living in #Paris? - Because I've always wanted to; I feel at home here: https://youtu.be/4Vivf6MqMxQ\n\nDo you speak French? Oui. https://youtu.be/va1QjaHgij8\n\nYou talk a lot about the books you're working on, what are they about? - They're sci-fi (and fantasy) and I've got a decent pitch for you here: https://youtu.be/W2bKt4_Tp4E\n\nDo you make money off YouTube? - Ha, no. I wish. It took me over 500 videos to make my first total $100 off adsense. I think it will slowly change, but VERY slowly.\n\nI really enjoy your videos, how can I support you? - The easiest and best way to support me is through Patreon, where you can pitch in as little as $1/mo to help me make better videos: http://patreon.com/jayswanson\n\nI don't trust this Patreon thing - can I just paypal you? - Here's my ko-fi if that's your thing (and coffee is your game): https://ko-fi.com/jayswanson\n\nBut I want to send you something tangible! - I do have a wishlist on Amazon, though it's a bit complicated with the international shipping situation.
