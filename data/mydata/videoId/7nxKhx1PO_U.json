As far as the updated version being free to those who had purchased the original, i honestly would be happy to pay for the updated version. You put so much work into what you do that the quality is well worth paying for it. Personally i wouldn&#39;t think twice about 5 or 10 for an updated version depending on how much you add. - Dan",
