 well release a vlog a day we don't think on this they'll make some sense today it's Thursday happy Thanksgiving sorry that took me much longer than it should have Happy Thanksgiving I guess belated Thanksgiving brother time you see this I'm having two Thanksgivings this year we'll start with one today I get asked a lot what do we do for Thanksgiving here and the question is very valid and it's kind of a challenge depending on where you are and like since I don't have an oven and I don't have it actually most cooking any things I definitely don't do Thanksgiving here I know I don't know anywhere to see anybody they flee the apartment that laura is renting this month has a lot of those and she actually imported pretty much everything that we need for Thanksgiving today I'm responsible for the mashed potatoes and bread because we're going to be doing turkey sandwiches instead of like a full-blown turkey because turkey the turkeys are too big for French ovens so I need to make sure that I pick up potatoes and bread for that this afternoon before that I have to meet Kate this morning because it's still a working day here in France and then hopefully we have a nice early Thanksgiving meal and maybe I'll come home and go to bed at like 6:00 and sleep for like 14 hours or more and that would be wonderful I'm sleeping really well on this thing by the way it's it's definitely enjoying my cosy cloud it's been amazing so I'm gonna go ahead and go get some work done and then I got to pick up some taters and then we're gonna mmm and then we're gonna have a Thanksgiving meal and it should be delicious [Music] just released to do wallpaper pact on patreon so if you're if you're at the wallpaper PAC level or higher figure what the name of that level is just go grab them there's a lot of fun ones all of them were taken with my new camera just kind of playing around having fun I haven't done a wallpaper pack in a while so I wanted to share some of those as a way of saying Happy Thanksgiving I'm thankful for you anyways I gotta go buy like a big bag of potatoes and some butter making mashed potatoes this afternoon and then we're gonna have Thanksgiving dinner numero uno also have a bag full of stuff for a mail call later so if you're interested in mail call make sure to stick around for that potatoes check I can't really lift them up on my face right now also tempted to walk the whole way to Laura's place but it's a little bit too cold kinda freezing here so I would but I just want I want to walk still nice out [Music] [Applause] wrote by this place all the time when I was doing bike tour isn't that boys women come in here and check it out through the night and the cappuccino that I got very tasty very smooth and there was like the chocolate coffee that was covered in truffle powder that was delicious hey like yours it's like surprising with your homey it was an almond I don't know what I'm talking about for a little pre-dinner walk we told these ladies we'd show them the Jardin du Luxembourg and so we're gonna go see the gardens coffee first and then a stroll up there do you know where you're going from here where is the best way to go back that way it up okay [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're on our way there's like no space inherits with lacking and utensils and containers [Music] Thanksgiving is over sir we had a really nice dinner you really film very much while we were going it was just nice to sit and chat and watch an episode or three of friends which I've never done before that's a new tradition for me to watch Thanksgiving friends episodes it was really really nice and as is tradition if you're not familiar with the mashed potatoes by the way it turned out great I'm very happy with how they turned out and then I had to come home and help my landlady because after seeing how clean the drapes got which I will show you in daylight maybe tomorrow she wanted to do her own drapes so she I had to go and help her unhook and she has a lot more than I do so that took a bit and then helped her with that a couple light bulbs and some other random stuff around the house it's nice to be useful every once in a while the meantime I told you that there'd be a mail call so I figured that while we do this mail call including this postcard of northumberland from Pat which is nice to see Pat today as well I would tell you couple things and things well I've been very thankful for a lot of things lately but I'm very thankful for my landlady for her generosity for making my life here
