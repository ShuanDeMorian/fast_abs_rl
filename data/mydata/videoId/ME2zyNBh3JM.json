The place I wanted to see the most, The Eiffel Tower, we didn&#39;t see at all, except from a distance in a bus, as it was pouring rain that entire day.  You showed me a Paris I never saw.

It is always interesting. Southern Italy is just different enough from northern Italy and the rest of Western Europe to make me feel out of my comfort zone to an extent. It is grittier.
