Very generally speaking prices in USA and Europe are similar, then take 70% off. But if it&#39;s already out of stock, then you&#39;re too late! So a lot of people are satisfied to shop in the beginning of the sales period which is now and maybe only get 10-30% discount. 50% also possible: a nice leather bag from 299 euro now at 150 euro or a perfume from 80 euro for 40.
