 vlog day 520 good morning it is early early morning in Paris I think that that counts but still almost 8 p.m. here in Los Angeles but take off I was literally the last person on the plane and apparently got called twice which means I was pretty close to not getting that on that's it not that close though there's give me her done anyways Genelia for display but I'd like where to give a comparison we'll be through soon enough the kiss in a water evacuation the escape slides detached from the aircraft and can be used as light rounds we're like forever sin to the flight I wish to movies repeat instant estate before Paul passage had not I probably shouldn't finish editing my blog I don't have a whole lot to enter yesterday still but I should probably get on top of it and yeah these lights just go by so much more slowly than you think they will like an hour left which is good these things are really fun actually there's no shade automatic settings I've been trying to recipe it's just slow we're passing you Kenny so that's fun pretty much over the channel we are very close to home and I had Wesley a week apparently I do get it me home because I couldn't grab and so interesting because they don't you don't go through customs to leave the states even though you do it here you're up you do it going in and out and in the state's you only do it going in something I only seem to have recently noticed well that worked out perfectly they didn't he didn't even ask to see my documentation just look at my passport stamped me and sent me through so that was easy welcome home welcome back to Paris it's good to be here I love this city I'm so excited to be back I love being here I just got to get out of this one last stop and we're good to go and just one tip for the airport for those of you who don't know this already is that you want to make sure that you go right immediately do these elevators you'll see trains there's an elevator Bank right behind them hit that and you're on your way perfect I was fully expecting that ticket to be demagnetized I've had it for like three years and it worked that was surprising look at it it's like Sun faded that's how old this thing is also the Train is here this feels like we need to get down there now we know it's in a writing one minute rain was not for us really the mean downside to taking the RER is that if the trains aren't running there's no one around to tell you why ever we just got to figure it out so this trains here I'll sit on it's supposed to leave in three minutes everybody out there looks very uncertain but I'll trust the screens no super that gets me another gamble this train that train even though on that train screen it says it's delayed 22 minutes this wasn't a movie vennett but you stand here so you can sprint across at the last minute just in case they swap on well they fell asleep for a moment I swear can I just say filming with these Bluetooth earbuds is like the greatest thing ever I don't have wires to compete with I'm not like getting down tangling stuff around plugging and plugging stuff back these are amazing it's automatically pasta music while I fill them and then good Oh wonder if it's recording through the microphone on them though I'm out see what if it's good quality or not here we'll find out soon there's of course the chance of one complication today which is that Kylie has my keys as a recall I let her stay in my apartment while I was away and she was apartment hunting she found an apartment very quickly actually I'm looking forward to hearing the full story on that and seeing the apartment and everything else is but I'm kind of reliant on her today to get back at my apartment there's a chance I can get a spare set of keys if she's not there but I don't know how good those odds really are so yeah that could also be a hindrance to I'm floating in wine we'll find out sir stop well finally heard back from Kylie she's not here she's nowhere near here right now it's my fault though I kind of I'm mixed updates I told her that I was coming on the 18th but I also said Tuesday cuz some reason in my brain I thought that the 18th was Tuesday this was just kind of the way that my brain has been working lately so anyways I'll set up my computer in the storage craw unless she locked the storage if she locked the storage then I won't be able to upload my blog at all actually because I need to plug in to render oh well well I'll figure it out the one downside is this might this means I might not be able to see lerka tonight because she I was hoping to see lurk and maybe Sonya tonight although I haven't heard Sun either but I was over to see lerka tonight before she leaves for London we haven't seen her a long time and she we just keep kind of swapping cities so I think she's headed to London in the morning if I don't get to see you lyrica I'll see you when you get back I'm sure I'm sure I'll see you again someday so so really warm here it's like 45 degrees or something like that not bad don't take it this is a nice surprise though they finally got rid of all the construction in front of my apartment looks like nice smooth turn at least on my side of the road over there's so much but this looks great always something good to come home to also it looks like the flowers is so I've saw silver lining left and right so now are you letting I'm tired this is getting rambley well who are deaf I was going to talk about something of some import today that's not happening thankfully she left the storage open so I'm able to plug this bad boy in and get it uploading on the Wi-Fi so this has never been on the Wi-Fi before some have to but you get the idea anyways don'ts gonna have a fear we'll figure it out thankfully I have one an outlet in my storage and do not open the fridge while I'm doing this because they're good so I couldn't meet you tonight I think photos have to call it everywhere I can hardly ever know she's actually gonna show up and I think I'm going to be able to wait tipic and how do you explain it especially cheese truck for a while so sorry see you back as for the rest of you I'll
