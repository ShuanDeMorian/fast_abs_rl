 that's loggin 8 926 [Music] just ran into a little bit of a problem I you know a better lighting and I don't have my the very first shot of the day I was just copying all the footage over to my computer and I formatted my camera but if that i formatted it before I film myself this morning but I was really tired today I did it after where's the footage so I guess anyways this is gonna have to substitute let's imagine that we're starting off the day I was very sleepy when I started the day very tired got up earlier than I wanted to but I need to start you know working on getting up earlier again set my alarm got up wanted coffee decided I would go to the palate on for coffee and a waffle and work for a little bit which spoiler alert goes really well and I think I also highlighted the fact that I've only got but two days left I don't know how many days welcome to the time vortex because today's Monday I forgot to say that forgot to say good morning I'm terrible at redoing introductions apparently and anyways there's only two days left to grab a postcard if you want to jump on patreon I will link below but if you wanted to grab that postcard or a bunch of new people that are gonna get one I think I'm sending one to in total like 150 people are some things if you want to jump in on that make sure you do and I'll send you one ah yeah but I have way less energy than I do now because spoiler alert number two new coffee I'm enjoying at the end of the day it's like 5:00 p.m. and I definitely should not be drinking coffee right now but couldn't resist uh so yeah let's just pretend it's the morning and now we're gonna go ahead and go to go get coffee you down at the peloton [Music] I got a lot of work done posted a new food poll on patreon I think I've mentioned that the post card offer is about to run out but that's a setting also there's there's so many things to talk about but got that figured out in Martin you're gonna be really excited to know that your package arrived not using it right now because I probably should be using right now I was gonna do an opening later but since yeah why didn't I just open it now could be using it right now we'll open it here in a minute but I'm gonna go for a little bit of a stroll we'll get some shots of the sunshine while it lasts cuz it's been so great for last couple days and then I gotta go find lunch and get back to work haha I got a lot done but I got a lot more to do got to get caught up took a day off now it's time to work work work work work [Music] one of the best parts about going and working at the peloton in the morning is that it means my afternoon is pretty much guaranteed a little stroll around the Marais whether that's checking out Notre Dame or walking on you'll smell Louie right now this is nice and quiet over here away from the traffic which is not on the island pretty much no cars no scooters I love it too anyway let's go find lunch and then you know get back to the hole a working thing which is a bakery and grabbed a sandwich on the way home she's not not quite enough actually but yeah I'll get more fruit here in a minute I'm going to try and do a live edit tonight which you're watching right now I suppose or watched last night or haven't seen yet but if you're watching the live edit you're watching the parade now we're getting really really inception you random well one of the things I that I wanted to do is open a couple of things because Thank You Martin this is a wristband that Martin sent me a while ago and it never made it and I don't know if this is the first one or if the new one got here that quickly but package delivery times and reliability across the European Union sometimes struggles I don't know if that's a France thing or if that's a whole European Union thing but it's not the same level of convenience as I'm used to it's in the United States at least not trying to knock anybody here just an that's a drawback to European living at least in France convenience you always lose out a little bit on the convenience front come on yeah it comes in little carrying case oh is this like does it come with an extra like little Sam oh this is the little nub that you interesting anywho this is a peak a peak design wrist strap for that camera so I'll be using that here soon which is gonna be pretty glorious Thank You Martin I'm really excited to put this on the camera and use it and keep from losing my camera for ever there's another package that came in while I was sitting there at the peloton Christian just handed it straight to me which is fantastic how do I open this this is there's a lot of tape I mean let's say give me you kidding I'm gonna have to look for scissors is this coffee whoa artisan Russ the jennszoo blend from Sumatra it's a Sumatra Brazil Rwanda blend from Edinburgh it looks like thank you so much Pat I appreciate it it smells great mm-hmm I was running low on on this bag of coffee so this is perfect I cannot wait to try this artisan roast is this the place I feel like this is the place that I went to when I was in Edinburgh looks really familiar is it was it I don't know there's a record of it I can go back and look thank you so much I will try this like in the next day or two I might even try it today it's a little bit too late for coffee now but very tempting falling asleep standing up Rachael Gibbs your patreon loyalty sticker got returned so I'll give this back to Kate we'll try to figure this out I'm gonna have to send you a note and figure out what your address is but thankfully it came all the way back from America so that's good I mean it's not good that bounced back but it's good that I got it back and last but not least oh I think this is from Kevin and Sarah just says kms letter J so how they were able to spend time with friends and family during the holiday season and celebrate your grandmother's birthday with her what an awesome surprise gift thanks guys I appreciate the letter I'm gonna read the rest of this right now but not on camera because I'm recording thank you for the letter that's very kind one more thing this is a thick one from Carol strum in Virginia it looks like it's wrapped whoo this gets mansur all the time mm eloped whoo sparkles joy love and peace whoa whoa that's a lot that is a lot of a lot of sparkles I'm gonna go ahead and move this away from the couch before the sparkle explosion continues Thank You Carol and Dawn both for the card and for the gift card and for reminding me that I definitely need to buy a vacuum cleaner sooner than later thankfully I have a method called wet paper towel that picks up most of the sparkles but at least it's golden glitter I mean it does go with the couch pretty well hmm you'd find that for weeks anywho I'm gonna wrap up some work here and then I'm gonna prep it like I said I'm gonna do the live stream and then I think I'm gonna do the live at it and then I think I'm also gonna stream a little bit tonight because that should be fun thank you so much for sending me that stuff you guys really appreciate don't want to try this coffee like right now cuz I'm also I'm just more huh I didn't eat enough ed when I said sandwich what I meant was like little tiny like French version of what a pizza is supposed to be like wasn't enough I just want some of this from Scotland I will resist because I don't want to have too much cop I should probably have some more I don't know I'm debating in the midst of this debate and also needing to find some food you need to
