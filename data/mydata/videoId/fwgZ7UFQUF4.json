Oui. https://youtu.be/va1QjaHgij8\n\nYou talk a lot about the books you're working on, what are they about? - They're sci-fi (and fantasy) and I've got a decent pitch for you here: https://youtu.be/W2bKt4_Tp4E\n\nDo you make money off YouTube? - Ha, no.

Tu m'as donn\u00e9 plus qu'envie de visiter le Panth\u00e9on, avec le pendule de Foucault et la vue superbe de la haut. Bravo pour ce vlog, et cette id\u00e9e de 20/20. Quel investissement humain intelligent qui donne du sens \u00e0 l'existence, tout en d\u00e9veloppant cette belle id\u00e9e dans la joie de vivre ! Il faut se rencontrer un de ces jours dans un de tes caf\u00e9s pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s ! Moi je suis souvent dans le 10\u00e9me, la ou se trouve la galerie en j'expose r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. 13 rue de l'\u00e9chiquier. M Bonne Nouvelle. Salut Jay.",

It is different when you must walk vs zipping on the wheel, have you ever taken the wheel when you travel?  We saw a couple in a show in the Hague (tv) and one of them said, it was only 3-1/2 hrs fast train to Paris!  One of the reasons I love Europe!  (One of so many)...

Around Christmastime, they have the most beautiful, intimate concerts inside. I highly recommend. I\u2019m glad you got to wheel a bit through the Jardin des Plantes. It is a really amazing place to walk around. I love the Cluny, too. Good stuff! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
