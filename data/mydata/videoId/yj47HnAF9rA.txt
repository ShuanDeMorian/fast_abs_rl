 oh sorry it's bought at a 719 Corning and spread it which means it's time for French Friday it's actually Thursday but just keep watching my blog that'll make sense later today I thought it would be a good opportunity to go and check out five of the best croissants in Paris there's a lot of croissants in Paris I don't know if you've ever looked at a map but the whole place is basically sprinkled in pastries we're gonna try and pick out five of those all across the cities so depending on where you're staying or visiting or traveling through the city you can always find a good croissant an amazing a couple new tools today I'm gonna be making a map stir of this and I'm actually using citymapper to get there which I never use citymapper but everybody loves it so we'll see how it goes we're not gonna be doing these in no particular order I'm just starting with the one that's closest because I am really really hungry and I just want to get straight to the lake to actually eating the croissants part so we're gonna go ahead and try five spots I'll put them all up I'll let you know how much they cost and I'll link to the maps and all that good stuff when we're done I'm hung [Music] problem one of the day I don't have my card on me I gotta go back and get my wallet earning these calories [Music] alright place number one is they got to a do pound which is a cake and bread it's gonna figure out where I'm going from here I'm really hungry ready for this [Music] we started out extra ritzy today as well give one bites hold on [Music] this is like the perfect appearing croissant looks really good it looks like it's gonna be flaky and crispy on the outside really soft on the inside and give it a bite here only gonna do one bite at a time and then revisit them later just to make sure that they're all kind of tasted on even footing there's a little bit of like a I don't know how to describe it cuz my palates not as refined as it should be but there's like a little bit of an extra bready taste to the crust that I'm not as big a fan of but it's definitely very fluffy on the inside very crispy on the outside here but some gentleness you never know that's my first impression we'll come back to it after we've had a chance to try some others but I'm gonna put this away now even though I'm really hungry and all I want to do is eat it I'm gonna make it the way that I discovered these I've never actually eaten anything cosponsor trying today I just did a bunch of research online hooked up whoo a bunch of different people said were the best and selected a handful across the city because be honest if you throw a dart at the map you're gonna be pretty close to a really good croissant that's the method whoo I'm hungry though [Music] asserted glassier that worked out really well actually we're on the same metro so for our self gotta take a quick walk to the next place we're currently walking in a 13th to Lowell Duchene is the place that we're headed to next topic last year it's something like a seven minute walk away apparently according to map maker way of course do appreciate the street art that you see around and also appreciate the fact that I'm mildly irritable because I haven't eaten anything yet today or had me coffee and every really obnoxiously loud noise seems to be fighting all the construction trucks in town this morning so keeping the sound good it's gonna be a challenge but aside from that the croissants should be delicious so you know we'll get coffee here damn it I'm gonna meet my friend Sonya after one or two more croissant places and then we'll get her opinion on the croissants as well so [Music] this guy was 125 I the last one was a Euro 60 I don't think I mentioned that this one's a year of 25 euro 60 is really overpriced for a croissant and for my first impression on the last croissant definitely overpriced well give this guy a try though see how it pans out let's be very good also I don't know if I'm walking the right direction I just started walking back towards this metro but I don't think I want to go to this one this one looks way different not nearly is like delicately refined busily sajo described it smells good though immediately they put just a touch of sugar on the outside so you get that Amisha like look also his butter is you'd expect a little bit chewier it's definitely not as flaky as last one was but it's generally kind of more pleasant first bite I would say this one is better but just personal preference a little less flaky a little bit chewier not usually in for chewy R but for whatever reason I like this one better if he's just like kind of the flavor on de croissant number 3 bonus 2 space invaders right next to each other [Music] you have noted what space invaders are I'll put a link to the video that I made hunting them street artists here in Paris that I absolutely love and if you are unaware of you should definitely look into before you get here because just makes walking around Paris that much more fun back to croissants bonus strata is one of my favourite coffee shops in the city they've got two locations this one is the big one lots of big windows lots of light really want to stop and get coffee because coffee but I'm gonna meet Sonia here after this next place at neighbours which is another really good spot not anywhere near here but it's where we're gonna go next huh I'm feeling better after having two bites of croissant I definitely am feeling a little bit more lively but all this walking in the heat that any food not highly recommended not not what I recommend anyways the next place we're gonna try forget the name up hold on a second oh yeah Eric Keyser one of the more famous spots in town we'll give that a try he's got I think three or four locations around the city now we'll take three of our five greatest croissants of all time to Sonya and see what she thinks [Music] one twenty cheapest yet and they've got another spot like five feet away if you have a line over there you just pop over here apparently they keep getting less fancy in appearance but might be getting better every time mmm this is flakier on the outside just a little bit on the two rear side very buttery began better I think I don't know if I'm biased I'm just gonna you increase enjoying with every bite but it seems like should go the other way feels really good there Kaiser one might be my favorite so far [Music] just stepped out into the bestie market like that who I want to go get a falafel sandwich for lunch so there's a guy that makes falafel here in the nest of the market that I really like but focus [Music] that's really good I couldn't good way for sunny any longer like at least papi has to have him and then some croissants and then like for other meals good something cuz they won't gonna see the croissants here we're gonna vote for Shane here we came outside because we weren't allowed to eat the croissants and we're we just work my brain is not functioning cuz I thank you for the quickie by the way I've had a cookie that's about it so we have I won't tell you which ones are my favorites okay I'm just gonna let you this is the Eric Kaiser we got I've got two more I'm gonna do but I'm gonna lose Sonya before then so I figure she's gotta try these before we get there you can see how much butter is in these because it's leaking through the bags okay okay there's Chris not number one here's the whole one Duchene I like the color yeah that one's very nice-looking they get to a dupe oh okay okay thoughts so what does she think yeah is a your favorite which is worth second place for you yeah and then every six takes third place for you okay there's saunders there's Sonya's thoughts on that I'm gonna eat more of them and I'll see if I concurred yeah this one that I put in third place I saw it's really flaky which I really really like a lot but there's something weird about the aftertaste that I'm not a big fan of it just tastes more there's gonna sound weird but it tastes more bready than it should to me I agree taste too close to bread not close enough to butter yeah yeah yeah too many plates I think oh they are still very good but this one kind of repressed one's way better than the other one so this is my second place one her favorite it's got a sweeter there's like a sweeter taste to it yeah and that's me face use I'm actually usually like oh you like this woman but it's good I don't know it's a good combo I think it's a good balance of butter and all ingredients and it's salty mmm oh yeah good you definitely would not go wrong with this one so that's below Hong Joo shin and now last but not least Eric let's see how air holds up on the second pass for Sonia and now Eric oh my favorite it's so much lighter than the other one's lighter I was like it's light fluffy it's lost a little bit of its crispy like flaky outside earnest outside earnest but the bank if he gave me some strawberry jam this would be the perfect person yeah and it's the cheapest of the three so far okay I'm gonna go find two more and we'll see what those are like but so far Erik's way ahead in my book and Sonia how do you build Wow alright I think we're on I think we're on the same page for the first three I'll let you know what the last two were like [Music] well this looks divine oh wow it's got all the flake a little more dense not so chewy this might take the number one spot and it's 125 hero 25 for this one so 5 cents more than Eric's and I think it's worth that extra 5 cents now the last place terroir devenir was in the second in a fantastic neighborhood actually there's tons of really good food around there so make sure to check that out currently the 18th however or walking into it from plastically she will try one last croissant also I have a meet-up going on tomorrow if you happen to see this when I post it so if you'd like to come out grab a beer please do tomorrow evening just check Twitter and you'll see when and where it's supposed to be because there's I'm trying to get meetups more often so even if you don't see this in time tell the another one coming up anyways last croissant and then I'm getting real food don't come Shelly a looks fancy [Music] oh yeah I will say this out of all the croissants that have tried so far this has got to be the most classically perfect looking croissant nothing weird about it nothing unique about it nothing just like perfectly my timing today anyways this one was a Euro 20 as well so that ties it with Eric for the inexpensiveness the lady working that I said it is absolutely the best little sushis right yeah that's pretty much perfect a little bit she reared them last them so depending on if you like chewier to last you even I would go between those two but if you're in the eighteenth or anywhere near it Shelly this is really good it's very light and fluffy but flaky on the outside highly recommended you can't go wrong with any of these except of course for the very first one I tried yeah unless you really want to get that whole like Apple Store croissant experience I just go for one of these it's amazing [Music] just to be sure two days we had to talked about the meet up make sure you through the meet up if you're in town but one of these forget to talk about with Sonia is that she's an illustrator friend of mine and she's one that design the shirt of the month this month so if you want to get a very Parisian slash Bloggie shirt out of the month that's that one this is going
