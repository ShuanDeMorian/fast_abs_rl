 I'd like to wish you a Happy New Year locative 533 when you see this there will be a new year happy new year I've finished mostly cleaning up I think I finished cleaning up I need to feed the cat for lunch and then I need to take off my laundry back to my apartment probably change into clothes that aren't filled with holes and garbage format you said you have my slacks to where were those true the New Year's Eve shenanigans tonight and yeah let's do it I want to try and actually sit down I can agree to something I did last night in India and that for a bit which was nice got a proposal off which I needed to get off and now I need to actually you know get other stuff done it's really exciting really exciting stuff so let's pack it up and get out of here [Music] a little cardboard sizes remind me cupboard side cardboard sign is reminding me to ask you please subscribe if you haven't subscribed yet that'd be really great of you I'm going to there were like two shirts that were still a little bit damp so I'm going to take those out and then we need to find lunch and put food in our bellies that'd be good it's a beautiful day out today I am loving this weather look at this [Music] I'll see you get a bottle of bubbly for the party tonight so maybe I'll just grab some sushi from the store it sounds quick easy and delicious so I'm running low on a few I'm running food [Music] and you can come back to three o'clock half-off up here that's a yep after three o'clock okay I would buy my champagne in two hours the meantime let's get some bananas and sushi [Music] all right sushi a banana it's time to go buy some champagne apparently in ten minutes they're gonna have a 50% off sale which makes sense doesn't sure they were stocked and I have a plan actually so I'm gonna buy two I'm not just gonna buy one half off we're gonna buy two and I'll tell you why I mean all of well I gotta get coffee as well but then we'll get bit more explain [Music] so I can't resist one more time okay it's not gonna be there forever back to the champagne [Music] that was super confusing because apparently it's 50% off of a future purchase so half of what you spent then comes back to words of future purchase I don't know but you don't get the deal until the first however in spite of that overpriced surprise said you get both bottles one because I do need one of them for tonight for the party and two I'll tell you in a minute we're gonna see if there's any coffee available over here really quick the awning is out but will they be open and no they're closed dang it well it's worth a try you can grab a coffee to go here from the pen Cody I'm sure it'll be goodness the staff made up for in kindness they're actually really really nice they gave me a bag to carry these in I already put one of them in the fridge across the hall this guy is for a very special purpose hold on one second this bottle gets open the day we crossed 10,000 subscribers well maybe sitting up there for a really long time but that'll just give us a nice visual reminder that we have things to celebrate coming in the future happy 2018 everybody one knock against penn cordova and possibly why the coffee didn't taste it that great this just came out into my mouth pretty sure it's a sugar packet was not expected does not pleasant this was heavy handedly emblematic of 2017 goodbye 2017 I am all showered and shaved and limited on what I can wear because I only have brown shoes need black shoes but that's a good we can wear blue with the brown belts we'll be good to go I'm going to finish getting ready here and then I got a head over to feed the cat one last time and the keys over to Rebecca and head to dinner that's the plan won't you join me please got stuck thankful it's raining outside I came back in to get my green jacket and realized that I'd almost completely forgotten to bring the champagne whoops I wondered if it was gonna be free transportation today it is free transportation that's nice need you by my name to go tomorrow one last feeding of the kitty cats waiting for Rebecca to come her train was late so we'll see [Music] come on in Ashley may be the last me sorry I was the cat's handed off to Rebecca time to go have dinner I'm really ready for - I'm hungry so I guess making dinner for a small group of us and then should blossom into a larger party have some bubbly welcome in the new year say good riddance to pests in 17 and then carry on from there and hopefully Rebecca will join us but we'll see if we see her again or not yeah that means I'm just gonna have a relaxing evening oh boy [Music] [Music] - all is there's 82 or 83 zadie this this one is follow the 1980s shoot arrows [Music] it's better than the 50 year old wine that we had before for sure [Music] [Music] [Music] 3:00 in the morning is 245 like we've all been invited over to apparently a really cool apartment an amazing Allegra's departments on renovation but we're gonna go to this next place and we'll I ready to go to bed but we'll see what the party needs us we'll investigate I can't avoid the curiosity of a really cool apartment so that's where we're gonna go next and I just don't know what that is in the bathroom apparently and then we'll get out of here here surely you super wonder what a pack of drunk French people sound like Oh [Music]
