 well this friend has left me unfortunately but it's vlogging a 863 [Music] good morning it's Monday Monday it's Monday in Paris wow that actually that came quickly and if everything goes well today I mean then it doesn't rain all evening I'm gonna go check out some Christmas lights this evening because it's been one of the more highly requested things that I do with my life so we can go check out some Christmas lights that are kind of a lot I feel like they're more this year than I've seen before it's not exactly sure there are a lot of options we'll hit up like three fun locations at least this evening and if all else fails and it does rain and we don't end up going out and doing that at least hopefully we'll get some space invader hunting in this afternoon and that'll satisfy you know my curiosities and needs for the week anywho I'm gonna go meet Kate and I know that Sam was gonna get her first waffle at the peloton so I'll just meet there and then the the space invader hunting can happen and then we'll just see what goes for what happens next [Music] there's no evidence to who left this behind but I'm guessing it was Angela Thank You Angela or whoever left these kisses but he was never had a Hershey's kiss because apparently they don't have these in Australia this is these are peppermint ones which are very festive they're extra you gotta figure out how to open it for yourself that's it all in one Jovi yep dude don't eat that there you go how many thumbs out of thumbs-up so you give it thank you very much and Merry Christmas I suppose is a very Christmassy I'm gonna I haven't had coffee yet and I'm having a hard time functioning the nice thing about getting sugary treats is that I can then share them with my own official post-office box which ways the fellas are they appreciate that so we're gonna head to the 17th mr goel copies of a copy has been acquired and some works been done sake briefly which is good well hop to the 17th cuz we never spend any time there but there are a bunch of space invaders that I've seen there and so the goal would be to collect those at least the ones that I've seen when push on and I were driving through not so long ago there a couple that I could not get so I wander around get some of those maybe grab something to eat along the way and then eventually it'll turn tonight and then we can transition into Christmas lights [Music] I already have a number we're gonna like Bugs Bunny I've already got but we're trying to get Sam a bunch cuz she's gonna be leaving soon I'm gonna make sure she gets as many French space invaders as possible also check out the Santa Claus [Music] do you have this one already you have both of them what that's the obvious one yep [Music] already have it did you have that one Oh we'll get you a new one eventually don't worry so we're getting a whole bunch of ones around Chevrolet if you've ever been to late al Chevrolet there are tons in this area and Sam doesn't have any of them we have all of them so this is pure pure for Sam but then we'll go to the 17th here shortly and at least get five or six is my hope I really want to get some but I know where a lot of them are down here so I'm able to very quickly get us through all of them one of them that was fairly new is on the font end is in assaults is originally called the nymph fountain and then was renamed for who knows why but it's the oldest monumental fountain in Paris like five hundred and some years old I think I mean I could back check that later I suppose but it's old it's not running anymore because they don't want the water to freeze but it has one of these invaders on it that is like fairly new probably six months old or something like that [Music] all right have that one - we'll get you a new one eventually all right time to change a run [Music] okay lunch first and then more invaders we've come to Rome for pizza hopefully see where you said there are a couple pizza places where are the other ones oh yeah more pizza [Music] [Applause] lunch and via Romo is good so basically is pizza by the slice add it to my master we're now on the hunt for invaders that none of us have although I might have one or two the ones that are up here we'll see but I know there's one just up there see how many we can find I'm hoping I get like five or six and I'm hoping these guys get closer to ten but I except to see how it goes I know there are a couple up here just to forewarn you so you don't miss them there are a couple [Music] we've gotten a handful now I think we've gotten like three or four for us let's see we'll keep going around this way see if you can find a few more and then hopefully take a break somewhere warm I'm thinking I might get a little editing done and let them like chill on my couch for a minute and then assuming that this rain does like I stopped filming with my main camera because I don't want so I don't want too much rain on my camera see this that's up then we'll go back out and find a couple Christmas lights there's helping dog is very grumpy I don't have any tea at my place so quick tea collection make tea hope we get a little work done warm up and then [Music] we're on the hunt for dinner we're gonna well I'm gonna do more Christmas lights here shortly but dinner first all right fed now nothing but Christmas lights [Music] yeah it's a good boy see the lion is the lion tamer there you go [Music] [Music] the lights in Montmartre aren't on so that's a big disappointment and this guy is just rolling his roller bag on the cobblestones even though there's a smooth side walk to the side anyways it's raining which is not supposed to do I'm not complaining just saying this sudden they got a little bit more challenging but we'll find some more Christmas lights [Applause] we found some that's all there are okay so Montmartre is a bunch of grinches apparently what the heck you guys come on we came for like the most true ste area this has got a got to have but that's the bone show over there that I was talking about that guy over there what do you want for Vaughn show I think we should check that guy out cuz he's outside and that makes him hardcore sold even of all show is closed good great citrusy tip 2 euro of osso here versus 650 like three doors up [Music] okay so those are not either what's happening [Music] we found some way way wait you can't see my hand way the heck down there we're not dedicated that we got it we running out of time and we want to see pass vend√¥me so that's where we're gonna go let next and last and I'm sorry that the camera just got jittery shouldn't be walking and talking ritzy bills not gonna disappoint there we go pretty low [Music] is he trying to hit himself in the face of the hammer what's going on here [Music] this seems like hazing [Music] we've hit the mother lode this is the Tuileries we were just walking through plasmon dum I didn't think that they were gonna be any markets but I did here this one is gonna be on and it looks like it is on in force so if you want to come to a Christmas Park in Paris she should really go to Germany for those but if you're gonna be here for the Christmas market definitely come here I'm gonna have to come back you're in like a couple weeks and do like a full actual thing on it but we can get a couple shots just to give you an idea what [Music] and there you go Christmas lights finally got some it's a little bit disappointing that the one special email mark weren't up and running that was unfortunate but I'm sure we'll go for some more Christmas lights hunting later so one of the make sure got you some hope you enjoyed it and I hope you enjoyed this wander through a variety of christmas Wonderland's some cheesy some a little less cheesy I will see you bright and early tomorrow morning or I think a Chateau tour it's finally up on the dock yet but we'll see when we get there oh and hopefully and hopefully the book giveaway for Natasha's book that make for a great day tomorrow anyways I'll see you tomorrow [Music] this actually terrifying looks like the Bears are trying to murder them [Music]
