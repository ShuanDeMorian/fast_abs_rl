Help me make better videos at http://patreon.com/jayswanson and then find me on the internet in all of the usual spots:\nhttp://twitter.com/jayonaboat\nhttp://instagram.com/jayswanson (me) http://instagram.com/mindofjayswanson (books)\nhttp://facebook.com/jay.swanson.author\n\nMusic by: DJ Quads - Um\n\nMy name is Jay Swanson - I'm an American writer living in Paris on an artist visa and hoping to make the city of light my home base - at least for the foreseeable future. I write science-fiction and fantasy, vlog daily, and love pizza a little too much.\n\nFAQ:\nHow long have you lived in France? On and off for over two years.\n\nWhat do you miss most about ho- NACHOS\n\nYou're always talking about living on some ship. WHAT SHIP? - I made a \"Draw My Life\" video that explains a lot here: https://youtu.be/-MrvL37jTKM\n\nWhere are you from originally? - Pullman, Washington - a small university/agricultural town near Idaho (and yes, the potatoes are amazing).\n\nWhat do you film with? - I currently film almost exclusively with my Samsung Galaxy S8: http://amzn.to/2lPKSpZ\n\nHow do you get those shots where you're walking or running? - A Joby Gorillapod for smartphones, like this: http://amzn.to/2sXNIL3\n\nYou drop your phone a lot, how does it survive? - THIS CASE IS AMAZING: http://amzn.to/2hoxgTA (Galaxy S7) - http://amzn.to/2Dt08Bu (Galaxy S8) - http://amzn.to/2FxVliP (iPhone)\n\nWhat do you edit with? - Adobe Premiere - it's pretty much all I've ever used since high school.\n\nAren't you ever freaked out by leaving your camera behind to film yourself? - Yep. But not too badly - I tend to be careful when I do.\n\nWhy are you living in #Paris? - Because I've always wanted to; I feel at home here: https://youtu.be/4Vivf6MqMxQ\n\nBut what are you doing there? - Living it up! https://youtu.be/ZW2RP--DO8Y\n\nDo you speak French? Oui. https://youtu.be/va1QjaHgij8\n\nDo you make money off YouTube? - Ha, no. I wish. It took me over 500 videos to make my first $100 off adsense. I think it will slowly change, but VERY slowly.\n\nI really enjoy your videos, how can I support you? - The easiest and best way to support me is through Patreon, where you can pitch in as little as $1/mo to help me make better videos: http://patreon.com/jayswanson\n\nI don't trust this Patreon thing - what's your PayPal? - Here's a handy link! https://www.paypal.me/jayswanson\n\nI like PayPal in pink! - Here's my ko-fi if that's your thing (and coffee is your game): https://ko-fi.com/jayswanson\n\nBut I want to send you something tangible! - I do have a wishlist on Amazon, though it's a bit complicated with the international shipping situation. This is the US one: http://amzn.to/2ykS9Ux\n\nAnd here's the French one: http://bit.ly/JaysFrenchWishList\n\nCan I come stay with you in Paris? - Have you seen my apartment? It's too small for me as it is! https://youtu.be/6t2qj3rdyX8\n\nOK, but how do I use the Metro when I'm there? - I made a handy video for you: https://youtu.be/T0YS5si8bJs",
