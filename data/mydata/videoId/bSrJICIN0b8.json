We've been in Rome for a few days now and we have saved the best for last. We're going to be eat at place called Antico Forno Roscioli (Marco Roscioli Il Forno).\n\nThis is a bakery and pizzeria that has been around forever. Yeah. It is a bit of an institution here. Early 19th century. It is like 11 in the morning so a bit early for lunch but I'm hoping they already have a few pizzas ready. Exactly. We're going to go in and eat pizza.\n\nWe are starting with our first batch of pizza and they had three different kinds ready. So we have mozzarella. Rossa which just means red. And pizza bianca. Which is just plain. This is all about the bread and the texture of the bread.\n\nOh my gosh it all looks so good. And apparently we have more pizza coming out of the oven in 3 minutes.\n\nI love it. It is just a little bit of tomato sauce and then you have the pieces of mozzarella. A little bit of olive oil drizzled on top.\n\nThis is amazing. It is not just a pizzeria. It is a bakery.\n\nPumpy is going to be trying pumpkin pizza so let's try that.\n\nWere you just given a complimentary pizza. Yes, probably because we're buying so much pizza. Oh my gosh. This is pizza bianca with mortadella.\n\nLots of pumpkin? Look at that. Smothered in pumpkin. Is it kind of a sweet pizza or? Oh yeah. It is really juicy too.\n\nThe last two ones to try. Mine is black cabbage. Yes. It has going to have a smoky flavor. That is what the guy told us. You can tell it is really crispy. And a little bitter he said.\n\nAnd Dad you're having what? Broccoli and pork sausage. Cheers. Let's do a pizza cheers.\n\nAlright we've had our pizza. We are stuffed beyond belief. We actually had the master plan of going to get gelato right after. We're like no. We've got to delay that.\n\nAnd that fed a whole family - the 4 of us. It only came to 31 Euros. I thought that was fantastic value. It was less than 8 Euros per person. And we pigged out. There is no other way to put it. \n\nWe're going to be going to a famous gelato spot next. And now gelato. We are at Giolitti. Sam's parents have already gone inside so we're going to follow suit and see what flavors are available. The boys and their ice creams.\n\nWhat flavors did you get? I had Roman Holiday \n\nThis is part of our Travel in Italy video series showcasing Italian food, Italian culture and Italian cuisine.  \n\nMusic by YouTube audio library.",
