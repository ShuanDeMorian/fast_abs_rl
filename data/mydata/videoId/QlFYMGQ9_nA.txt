 are we be running up the gangplank now it's vlog a day 920 it's finally snowing in Paris at least to my courtyard there's a chance that it's not really snowing very well outside because those are very tiny snowflakes and I want to go exploring but unfortunately I actually have to leave like very very shortly to go to see NRS to do the voice recording for the scripts that I've been translating the last couple it is a week yeah I'm gonna go buy a sandwich for outside I'll try to leave early enough that we can you know try to get some shots of something I don't know I want to go exploring that's all I want to do right now why do I have to [Music] alright I'm up fed myself got a sandwich in me which is really good and got the scripts from mostly at there's about as polishes they're gonna get at this rate this was quite a blitz I mean trying to translate three scripts with friends in town over the course of one weekend was that was ambitious it worked out but I definitely went back to burning the midnight Oh a little bit on that one anyways it's okay that they're not completely polished because they didn't really can be there's a lot of work that has to go into him still not a lot hopefully just a little bit but I realized I didn't talk about the process of actually recording these the other day when I was talking about doing the translations so I'll try to you a better job of explaining what the process actually is like in the recording studio first we have to get there hopefully without freezing first dad I think that's it I think that's fair hope [Music] [Applause] my dear [Music] here's hoping we keep the snow for longer than a days this is just magical having snow around it's turning slushy a little bit already melting less outside of Paris than it was in Paris but it never lasts as long as you wanted to [Music] [Applause] you know you're with Nick when you go straight for the coffee machine where is the list that random one that makes me think I know it's gonna be in it never his brakes but oh yeah [Music] hello good how are you doing basically we're gonna do here is read through the scripts one at a time and just make sure that they sound good that I didn't put weird word traces in here and then what we have an Englishwoman here to correct my Americanisms as we go where is it though that was right oh that's the French one I'm useless any who will read through it we're not gonna read through this on camera I want to see how many mistakes I made no hidden from daylight termites insects often considered a nuisance have occupied the soil of our planet for over 200 million years yet their social structures remain largely unknown misunderstood enlarged so once we've gone through as a team and honed in on what we think the best wording for a lot of things is make little changes sometimes like my word choice is a little bit too literary or we just don't understand what's happening for whatever reason the way that it's phrased and rework it massage the text then we start hopping in the recording booth and actually record these things which is a lot of fun this one we're doing we're talking about terms like it's kind of gross it's it's it's a termite Queen that lives for 40 years and they're trying to figure out why how does she manage to do that and I think it's the food that's getting puked in her mouth every day and that it's just it's pleasant fragile you don't just get the insides until you find it the creatures of the plays record for Queen and this is where the couple [Music] ten million dollar bill is a souvenir cuz he actually went and filmed these down in Zimbabwe I want a trillion dollar note and then when we're done with all the talking into the microphone which happens to you know have its own stumbles and fumbles along the way we can get out of the death box here and into something a little more echoey with a little better air and voila we've done three we did all three of them next he's already gone off she works for France 24 so she's got to go be a news anchor on the air tonight and Nick gets to do all the narrator bits later I'm guessing are you doing them now or doing them today oh man so he's gonna get some coffee and then he's gonna be sitting in there for a long time and I got to go home because there's a an update on Kody and Laura actually got stuck here in Paris for a day and they don't have anywhere to stay so they'll be trying out the chateaus extra features tonight let's see if I can properly host two adults again in my tiny little space so I got to go home and get them and make sure that they're okay and not covered in snow they're just trying to hit all the stereotypes right now anyways oh good recording session I'm gonna grab a Galago on the way home as recommended by Nico because he said there's a really good wind just up the street and I gotta go get something to eat along the way to I'm starving and of course they're closed the way it always goes I do need to get together to wash soon though it's the season for them and it's so good and I haven't had one yet this year so maybe we'll try to find one for Kody and Laura back in Paris but time to go back to Paris [Applause] that there we go Johnny even Fred came over and played Smash Brothers the other night which is amazing Sunday night we ended up getting pizza and the hosting works it's not it's not the best it's like nothing out the best for hosting people and eating especially but it works it's good I'm gonna I'm gonna get this food out they convinced me to keep this tiny little table in here to bowl the plates but we have to move that soon because Cody and lar gonna be sleeping here so no further ado I think I'm just gonna tidy up around here and just make sure it's ready for them we'll probably grab dinner or something edit and hopefully go to bed at a reasonable hour because we got to bed I mean I think that's bedded like 3:30 last night or something like that a little bit late just a little bit late actually maybe even later I'm not sure it was it was late worth it really fun but really late so I leave you here hopefully we get some more snow tomorrow and I can go out and explore the city covered in snow but most of it's already melted here this evening it looks like as I was walking around suppose that's the way to find out what's going on tomorrow I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for hopefully a bright and snowy day in the city of Paris see you tomorrow I'm just gonna turn this off now wrong way [Music]
