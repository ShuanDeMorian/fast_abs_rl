 hello people of the internet world welcome back to my channel I'm Kerry rad if you are new here and if you've been here before welcome back today we are going to be doing another travel style video this video is going to be important tips you need to know before traveling to Italy as most of you guys know I spent about a month in Italy over the month of January I was pretty much living there and I learned a lot about traveling to Italy if you follow me on Instagram you know that there was some very intense drama when I landed in Italy the very very first day no guys I am popping in here really quickly because some of you I saw onto my Twitter about four or five hours ago that my mom and I had pretty much everything we brought with us to Rome stolen out of the car that we had locked car the main reason why I want to tell you what happened is because there's so many lessons I learned that I really want to share with you guys so you can bring it with you on your journey to Italy or really anywhere in the world please take a moment to make sure that you guys are subscribed to my channel with notifications turned on it's that Bell button right next to the subscribe button that way you'll never miss a new video for me give this video a thumbs up or Italia first and foremost let's talk about flights to Italy if you're in the market for a ticket to Italy please know that there are flights that are less expensive than what you would think a lot of people think I'm not going to Italy it's way too expensive for me to fly there and I was very pleasantly surprised when I started looking up flights if you do your research and you make sure that you're looking up flights on you're probably like a Tuesday I'd say is the best day because just so you know Airlines do change their prices on different days of the week people are looking more for flights on like a Friday than they are on a Tuesday so sometimes the prices are a little bit lower midweek but in general tickets to Italy are a lot less expensive than I expected obviously they range but you can find cheaper flights if you look hard enough once you land in Italy they use euros there so obviously if you're coming from the US or a place where the currency is valued a bit less during that time you're going to be spending a little bit more money with the conversion rate so when I was in Italy if I spent about a hundred euro I would be spending at least like 130 140 150 euro depending on what the rate was that day I made sure to bring a travel credit card with me that had no international transaction fee because a lot of people don't realize that if you have just a regular debit card or a regular credit card every time you swipe your card when you're out of the country they give you an international transaction fee and that can really start to add up don't carry a ton of cash on you but always make sure you have stuff because not all places take card and you'll run into a lot of situations especially at small markets and places like that where you do need to have cash available you can pull out euros at the ATM you can convert your currency before you leave the country you can convert it when you're there that's totally up to you however you feel comfortable but I want to just say again and reiterate the fact that do not carry a lot of cash on your person because pickpocketing does exist in Italy and it happens quite often that leads me into my next point which is theft robbery pickpocketing all of those gross things that you have to deal with when you are travelling in such a beautiful place where everyone wants to be first off pickpocketing keep your cash and your most important items where you can see them at all times do not put them in the front pocket of your backpack or even your backpack in general make sure it's on a crossbody a fanny pack somewhere in the front where you can see what's happening that you can keep a hand on it be aware of your surroundings there's a lot of crowded places in Italy especially if you're going to the fucking at a trevi or the Colosseum those areas have a lot of people and that's where a lot of theft happens you're looking at all the beautiful sights around you and you're not really paying attention to your cash so just make sure that you're always kind of in it and realizing where you are where your money is and who's around you not only pickpocketing but pretty intense robbery can happen and happened to me on my first day in Rome and guys so emotionally and physically exhausted right now I feel like I just Essam be I cried for the first three or four hours that it happened and it was just so violating like I dropped my knees when I realized I landed in Rome we were switching from our Airbnb to my Xia's house in the countryside of Rome we stopped really briefly at the Ponte headed heavy to just throw a coin in make a wish the world the wonderful things that you can imagine and we got back to the car and the luggages were gone out of the trunk of the car so we freaked out there was a lot that we dealt with there was a lot of questions there was a lot of drama we ran down the street to the police station the first PlayStation didn't really want to deal with our problems so we went to the second police station that was so much more helpful I ran to a hotel ASAP to connect to the Wi-Fi to get on where's my iPhone to find my macbook because they took my computer they took all of our clothes obviously they took my camera is a lot of equipment that I had for work we dealt with it that night was really hard the first thing that we had to do was go get a toothbrush and toothpaste just the simple things that we needed the only thing I had on me was my wallet my passport which were both in my side crossbody bag and then in my backpack I had my camera because I was taking pictures of the funky that is heavy so I got lucky in that case that I didn't have to deal with a stolen wallet or stolen Passport and I also got lucky that I had my biggest camera in my backpack but everything else that I packed for a month in Italy gone if you told me that that was going to happen to me a month before I left to Italy I would have looked at you and said you're crazy I'm not going there's no way I'll be able to get through that it was really interesting how resilient we are as human beings my mom and I just kind of looked at each other and yeah it was devastating but at the same time we were like well we're going to make the best of this situation we're gonna figure out how to get through this we're gonna get the essentials that we need to get by are here in Rome we've been dreaming of this trip together for as long as I can remember and we're here in Rome and we're we're gonna have a good time we're not gonna let it ruin the trip things are just things and we could survive without them renters insurance who knew I was lucky enough that my boyfriend's mom knew to contact renters insurance she sent me an email while I was in Italy and said do you happen to have renter's insurance because that might cover so right away I called my renter's insurance and I said is there a way does my policy cover for travel abroad and it did and in that moment I was so thankful because I really did just right off my losses I was sort of like I lost everything for work I have to figure out a way to get everything back I lost a bunch of clothes which wasn't a big concern to me it was more so all the equipment that I used to make videos for you guys had to go through the whole process of documenting every single thing that was in my luggage obviously they will devalue things when they were used that's my computer I have had for a very long time so that was devalued pretty low but then when you go in and purchase a new computer they will reimburse you for the price of the new computer so that was really helpful to me never realized that would come through for travel insurance or being robbed out of the country so that's why I wanted to tell you guys this story and just give you that information because if you ever deal with something like that know that your renter's insurance will cover any of you don't have renter's insurance then maybe this puts the fire under your bum to go get it because it's worth it next let's talk about language wherever you go in the world it's good to learn so basic things like hello goodbye where's the bathrooms that will get you by especially in Italy people will respect you a little bit more if you try to speak the language even if you just learn child which is super easy because it's hello and goodbye I would recommend also learning Gaddafi a because it's very nice to say thank you to people if they open the door for you any waiter that serving you go back see a will go a long way I was really lucky when I was in Italy because I had my full-blooded Italian mother with me she can speak fluent Italian and fluent and Napolitano so when we were in northern Italy we got by really well and when we were in southern Italy in not believe my mom was speaking Manipuri sad no I made sure when I was there to learn language as much as I could and today I would like to say that I can speak a little bit more Italian than I could when I entered Italy I made sure to ask my cousins how to say specific things because we were with family a lot and one of the things that they taught me to say to Alex my boyfriend was that my own butt Chihuahua to me when enough give me a kiss my love goodnight all the most important things like maybe I won't got Pacino but I Lauren can I have a cappuccino please speaking of language barriers one of the hardest times I had in Italy when it came to speaking a different language was when I rented a car I even had my mom with me who speaks great Italian it was still a frustrating experience unfortunately and I thought that maybe it was just the experience I had with my mom but then weeks later when I went back to rent a car with Alex my boyfriend we have the exact same type of frustration it was sort of just this experience where there was this random charge that didn't have a very good explanation going back and forth nobody really understood the charges and what they meant and there were random up charges and it was just a very confusing situation both times that I experienced it I would highly recommend that you do not go through a third party or booking agency goes straight to the source go straight to your main car rental place like your hurts your budget all of those main car rental companies go straight to them because there's going to be a charge that just is there's no purpose for it wanted to mention that I think it's completely worth it to pay a little bit extra each day for a trunk that is separate instead of getting a car that is all one body where you can turn over the backseat and see the trunk it's better to get a trunk that is completely separate and that locks separately once you are in the car you are now driving in another country which good on you because that is a huge learning experience and it's very empowering I drove when I was in France I loved the experience it didn't drive in Italy but I was a passenger for about a month and I realized that people in Italy don't always abide by the rules of the road here in LA we abide by the rules of the road to a certain extent obviously there's like the California roll through the stop sign type of thing and in LA there's tons of traffic people have known how to drive in the rain so there's all that we have our own issues here in California driving in Italy is a whole different experience and adventure in itself people do not use their blinkers when they are switching lanes they go pretty fast most of the time to pass you they will pull up right to the butt of your car and they will just say get out of the way pretty much it's pretty intense they don't really mind to just kind of weave in and out go fast and sometimes I just think to myself like don't they know like how dangerous that whole situation just was just stay calm at the wheel go with the flow relax don't get too stressed out just know it's gonna be a little bit different than when you're home but that's travelling in general everything is different from the way it is I would like pull my feet up on the car and just like freak out and feeling my whole body was like freaking out because I was I guess trying to press the brakes even though I didn't have the brakes on my side let's talk about the Italian most people forget that from about 1:00 to 4:00 p.m. everything for the most part is closed there are some shops that stay open because they're the ones that are like we're going to stay open when everybody's sleeping so that we can make a little bit of extra money which is smart but most places close down because they go home and they eat with their families and it's so time to eat and take a nap and I think it's genius and I wish every single place in the world did this but it's something to recognize and to remember when you're there because if you want to go to a shop you want to go to market if you want to do something midday like that you're gonna run to a lot of places be enclosed when Alex and I were in Tuscany there was a moment where we were so hungry for lunch but everything was closed so we were just walking around we couldn't even get food in a market or anything like that because we just completely forgot about the siesta that day speaking of food and looking for food I highly recommend you eat like a local there don't go to all of the restaurants that are right near all of the touristy destination for instance there's plenty of restaurants near the Coliseum that are a little bit more expensive just because they're right near the tourist destination although we did find a really good spot like close to the Colosseum but like a little bit further down that was delicious and not super expensive so if you just go a little bit further out than these touristy locations you'll find some great places and do your research I use the ALP a lot I like to read the reviews that people leave about different places and just because a restaurant is empty does not mean that it's not good especially if you are in Italy during the winter or during months where it's a little bit slower lastly I want to talk about the pizza and Napoli because a lot of people eat the pizza very weird in Napoli which is what a Napolitano would think when they look at you because in the u.s. obviously we slice our pizza and we pick it up by the slice and we eat it that way and Napoli they eat it like a big pie they use a fork and a knife or they use their hands and tear it but they mostly use a fork and a knife and they cut like from the middle or from the side they eat it just any way that they want to they don't want it sliced and they don't slice it for you and when you asked for it sliced they look at you really strange so to avoid that eat like a local and just eat it the way that they do because oh the piece of food is so good and I don't want you guys to feel awkward when you ask for it sliced because it's a it's an awkward I knew because my mom is Napolitano but I had a table right next to me it was a group of Chinese people and they asked for it to be sliced and the man from Napoli just kind of looked at them like are you serious as soon as I was like oh no so just I don't want that to happen to any of you guys so I just want to put that out there I know that that's a random side note and that's a weird place to leave off but I'm leaving it at the pizza and not believe why not one of the most important things that I've learned in my days of traveling is to learn to do the research do the pre-production I guess you could say on your trip because it's so important to know what's going on before going into it because I have had many moments where I'm in a country thinking why did I not know this I should have known this that's why I think videos like this are so important to do if you're trying to inspire people to go places in the world and see different cultures it's just really important to sit down and talk about the things that I've learned the hard way so that hopefully you don't have to go through it it's a hard way you can go in knowing what to do having all the information that you need so hopefully this video is super helpful for you guys if it is please remember to give it a thumbs up so that I know to make more videos like this and make sure that you guys are subscribed I hope you guys are having an awesome day and have the best time in Italy if you are planning a trip there well whatever you might be doing please let me know in the comments I want to live vicariously sure you because I want to be in Italy right now so bad I miss it like crazy there's a lot of information that I put in this
