Is Notre Dame de Paris worth it? Absolutely. It's free, quick to get in, and really nice to wander through and even sit and contemplate life for a little bit. The cathedral of Notre Dame is one of the best examples of Gothic Architecture in the world - certainly in France - and it shows.\n\nMy name is Jay Swanson - I'm an American writer living in Paris on an artist visa and hoping to make the city of light my home base - at least for the foreseeable future. I write science-fiction and fantasy, vlog daily, and love pizza a little too much.\n\nFAQ:\nHow long have you lived in France? On and off for over two years.\n\nWhat do you miss most about ho- NACHOS\n\nYou're always talking about living on some ship. WHAT SHIP? - I made a \"Draw My Life\" video that explains a lot here: https://youtu.be/-MrvL37jTKM\n\nWhere are you from originally? - Pullman, Washington - a small university/agricultural town near Idaho (and yes, the potatoes are amazing).\n\nWhat do you film with? - I currently film almost exclusively with my Samsung Galaxy S8: http://amzn.to/2lPKSpZ\n\nHow do you get those shots where you're walking or running? - A Joby Gorillapod for smartphones, like this: http://amzn.to/2sXNIL3\n\nYou drop your phone a lot, how does it survive? - THIS CASE IS AMAZING: http://amzn.to/2hoxgTA (Galaxy S7) - http://amzn.to/2Dt08Bu (Galaxy S8) - http://amzn.to/2FxVliP (iPhone)\n\nWhat do you edit with? - Adobe Premiere - it's pretty much all I've ever used since high school.\n\nAren't you ever freaked out by leaving your camera behind to film yourself? - Yep. But not too badly - I tend to be careful when I do.\n\nWhy are you living in #Paris? - Because I've always wanted to; I feel at home here: https://youtu.be/4Vivf6MqMxQ\n\nBut what are you doing there? - Living it up! https://youtu.be/ZW2RP--DO8Y\n\nDo you speak French? Oui. https://youtu.be/va1QjaHgij8\n\nYou talk a lot about the books you're working on, what are they about? - They're sci-fi (and fantasy) and I've got a decent pitch for you here: https://youtu.be/W2bKt4_Tp4E\n\nDo you make money off YouTube? - Ha, no. I wish. It took me over 500 videos to make my first $100 off adsense. I think it will slowly change, but VERY slowly.\n\nI really enjoy your videos, how can I support you? - The easiest and best way to support me is through Patreon, where you can pitch in as little as $1/mo to help me make better videos: http://patreon.com/jayswanson\n\nI don't trust this Patreon thing - what's your PayPal? - Here's a handy link! https://www.paypal.me/jayswanson\n\nI like PayPal in pink! - Here's my ko-fi if that's your thing (and coffee is your game): https://ko-fi.com/jayswanson\n\nBut I want to send you something tangible! - I do have a wishlist on Amazon, though it's a bit complicated with the international shipping situation. This is the US one: http://amzn.to/2ykS9Ux\n\nAnd here's the French one: http://bit.ly/JaysFrenchWishList\n\nCan I come stay with you in Paris? - Have you seen my apartment? It's too small for me as it is! https://youtu.be/6t2qj3rdyX8\n\nOK, but how do I use the Metro when I'm there? - I made a handy video for you: https://youtu.be/T0YS5si8bJs",

My first visit to paris something like 20 years ago, and then the last visit 2 weeks ago.  <br />If you are getting up early- I think it&#39;s the best time to see the inside, I don&#39;t know when it&#39;s open regularly but it was Pentec\u00f4te, so I was there around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW1Ks8UERSY&amp;t=07m00s\">07:00</a> o&#39;clock, and there were very few people- almost nobody actually, I just got inside and could admire the place without suffocating from the crowd, which was lovely! In the afternoon there was also a ceremony, which was nice to watch as a spectacle. <br />I also think that people should see the place at night- beautifully lit :)",

She was making plans to visit London, Rome, Paris and Doublin again after the 2 week class. That was when I ran across your vlog when researching Paris; you had all kinds of wonderful Paris tips-she used every on of them! We&#39;re so glad we watched this, esp since my daughter and son did not go inside to see it...they chose to take in the celebration of the last France Football game win before they won the World Cup. My daughter was more interested in the outdoor architecture as she was on an Art and Architecture Super Bowl team in high school. They won 1st place! She was satisfied seeing the outside structure of Notre Dame. Anyway both of my children were very happy to see this vlog to know what it looked like inside. In view of the circumstances of Notre Dame&#39;s fire destruction, your vlog was very valuable. Archive this vlog! It&#39;s a valuable part of history for many who follow you. Especially to the person who got the Camera 5 photos of Notre Dame! TY for your passionate work Jay!",
