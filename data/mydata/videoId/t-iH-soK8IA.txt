 they never tell you the time when I was like the world's bestest lifeguard I was super ripped and actually David Hasselhoff was out here drowning and I rush out there to save him and I grabbed her scooped him up and I carried him back to shore cuz just vlogging 966 and he's like no it's not it's lightning 965 and I was like David Hasselhoff if you disagree with me one more time I'm gonna join you right now I don't care how precious you are oh look at this guy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] good morning it's Saturday and I'm away to a bike to her Lizzy that a met doctor we've seen him as logical times I met her through bike about tours and she's doing bike tours of them we just branched out to do a whole myriad of things I did her New Year's Eve bar crawl if you'll recall that she's doing a lot of things like that and lots of other things that are gonna be really interesting I have the opportunity to join her for a bike tour today we'll be joining her again very soon for a lot of interesting stuff which we'll leave to mystery for now I'm gonna head down to the peloton to meet her go for this bike tour and I'm gonna try and shoot the entire vlog on my brand new pixel 3 which I have it in a cheap case that's kind of protecting it until my tech 21 case gets here hopefully gets here very soon but we'll see how this goes I just wanted to try out the new camera try out the new all the new vet fend England that doohickeys and whistles and do Bob's see how it turns out so with no further ado let's get down there and find our bike [Music] we're just really curious to see how this does in a variety of ways that I'm used to using a phone whenever I don't use my phone as much when I blog anymore because I've got my camera but you know there to give a try to see I think that the angle on the lens sexy a little bit more narrow than I'm used to so that's one thing and then [Music] it's Kate hi step 1 grab of a leap or attend I don't know I grabbed a bite from I have to peck from next door [Music] one of the key components of this looks to be an ice cream ran off the bat which it's not a bad way to go Pepsi on its own ice cream you'll hear about if you aren't already familiar with it in Paris it's made on the island that we're on right now smell let's have some had some you know what it's included in the torso [Music] as did what literally means strawberries of the woods - wild strawberries or like little extra sweet strawberries I love strawberry this is got amazing [Music] I already had my first bike accident of the season - you gotta get it out early but this lady went when I went to turn I had my ice cream in one hand with to turn and stop here and she decided that was the time to try and pass ran straight into me thankfully I managed to save my ice cream and catch her before she felt I ended up on the ground but I managed to stop her anyways it worked out probably gonna be a little sore from it but not too bad I did lose a shoe when I went over what I'm fine I was just explaining the spill on camera yeah a little sore but otherwise I'm pretty good be fine like my if my ice cream is spilled out up in the real tragedy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so far on the pixel side of thing is it's doing really well actually it's really smooth the software works really quickly I'm not sure that I'm a huge fan of how its laid out exactly but I feel about the lens [Music] the tour is nice basically the first half has a lot of overlap with the bank about to work however there are some differences like stopping in sentiment they pay what's nice that's different and they're a couple of John's here effectively why what's different about this tour is that we're actually gonna go all the way to the Eiffel Tower in the end so we're leaving the overlap right now get a little bit more time on the river riding it's just nice to get out and ride a bike bummer bounce around Paris even if the weather's been going between sunny and cloudy this is not reading happen to be this morning random side story but I rode my wheel to get something to eat this morning and they decided to start pouring right when I stepped outside I will repel will think it's very unruly sometimes yeah almost had a very great soaked angry wheel coalition to it the grounds of crash you know but it's fun to be on the tour Valkyrie has a lot of walking tours and bar crawls all that kind of summer sunny about I'll let her give them a pitch about what she does if you're looking for a good time that's chill and relaxed she's not trying to run this like a traditional tour company she's trying to make something that's a little bit more relaxed like you're hanging out with friends doing your own thing of course it's got a croissant or like a how to making croissants I go to Sunday detour that I really want to go on bar crawls like you've already seen and a bunch of other fun stuff so we're gonna give that all a try here than not just the future but you know might as well get a little bit of bike exercise here today Oh police barrier Julie John okay just aa corn please see you play Nellie nasiha okay that doesn't happen on every tour but that was definitely the highlight of this store he did it like four times and if we managed you're gonna be a one last time you're gonna do it you got it you got this you're a natural it was beautiful yeah [Music] oh maybe this guy [Music] that's so much quieter over here all of a sudden it's nice written I've ridden my wheel obviously by the Eiffel Tower recently it's more intense I've ridden a bike over here if I've ever ridden the bike by the Eiffel Tower I don't need November [Music] we deserve a bubbly toast from the conquered Paris on bikes [Music] you're empty you can't do that that's bad there's technically something inside of it so doctor you give people the quick pitch about what what's going on what is going on when you move to Paris it's an excuse for everybody so you quickly learn how to take them to see all the things that everybody wants to see Paris is world-renowned for reason because we figured out a way that we well this is the way we take our friends to visit us so that we could see everything up close so we take little back streets bike lane ride we see absolutely everything you want to see the link below if you want to hook up with Valkyrie and go on a ride but like I said we're also gonna be do you want to meet up with Valkyrie we'll also be going and doing a whole bunch of other tours like I said in the in the near future from like a croissant they actually make your socks on that so we have two things we walk to the best possible of Paris and we check out some amazing bakery some of them well-known some of them in the neighborhood terms and you can kind of pit them against each other about which one has my song cause they're all different and then we also have where you could go into a bakery of a Michelin listed chef awesome and you can make bread finish up a lot and puzzle in his bakery and it's pretty cool to be doing that one of these days sounds really good put that on the calendar okay anywho I'm gonna finish drinking my rose' here and I'll catch up with you in a second oh that was quite the day man that did go a little bit longer for those who they were wondering about especially the lighting change we're a little bit longer partially because the disruptions on you know Saturday you're happy Saturdays and also because it was the last kind of run-through for a lot of people that are going to be taking over that route so a lot of those people you saw your cluding cake will be doing that route with you if you want to join them and go through and what's neat about it section Express version it just kind of runs through it's a nice bike ride through the city sees a lot of the big sites and does so fairly quickly with fewer speeches so I think the whole the whole crux of what Valkyr is doing is to try and give you a relaxed version of coming to Paris and just hanging out with friends who live here that kind of side of things is set up more of a formal tour so do we call to go see her walking stuff and for those of you who aren't into bike tours I know a lot of you aren't to show you some other options that you might have in parts of Paris that you might not find without somebody like Valkyrie taking you around I got a lot of work to do tonight I've got to be tomorrow is that I'm gonna finally let you know what's going on with the game I'm gonna try and do my best to explain everything and I hope that you'll come along with me for that it'll be interesting say the least and otherwise I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for that yeah enough any piece of food now because there's a lot of bike Breton today and now I get to reap the covert rewards [Music] [Applause]
