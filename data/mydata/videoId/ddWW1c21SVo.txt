 it is logging a 1019 and you know what this wouldn't I when I was on vacation and friend oka back [Applause] [Music] good morning and welcome so 19 of my 20 and 20 Sean's with me we're gonna go meet some other people here in a minute I think we're in the 19th arrondissement of Paris which is in the northeastern section of the city it is a really big around nice Mont there's a lot going on not normally one that I would recommend you come if it's your first time in Paris at least to stay but if you're gonna visit you should definitely come visit the canal we're gonna hit up with number of different things including one of my favourite parks in the city but first we're gonna see about a little coffee boutique and maybe get our second coffee today poo Shan treated me to coffee to start so I'm gonna start off to a good off to a solid start though two new invaders right off the bat I have almost caught up to Danielle and her kids coming for you guys okay sorry anyways right now we'll get this invaded then we'll actually go to the is what we're going where Belleville actually does they're roasting now all they're roasting its when it's their flagship if they're like their flagship store and they do their velvet is one of the og Coffee Roasters here in Paris and so I've yet to go to this new location but I need this baby I need using Bader more than I need coffee huzzah one of the other things we've already run into today as well as it is may days the first amaze so it's as your family a so you'll see the Red Cross for example among others out selling flowers to raise money it's a great day to buy a flower for your mom if you live around here from sean's gonna do that later cuz he's a good son but it also means closures and protests we had some struggles getting here because our metro lines were closed down so we had to walk a little extra far I mean don't expect anything to happen in the 19th but it does mean we might have to both dodge a couple of places if there are protests and you know there may be closed stores along the way but thankfully Laura whoa flappy bird thankfully Laura is already at the coffee shop we're going to so we know that it's open look at that big floppy bird yeah nope okay wait this is a great one for [Music] Hey how's it going [Music] well it could be cool if you want to come you can do a couple ike they'll do a whole experience and make all kinds of coffee for you but it takes like three hours and that's not what we're here for and these guys are melting without their coffee so we should probably start moving towards the canal [Music] this place is really cool because when you go in like he's describing it still feels like a house inside you've got bedrooms you can sit in you can even sit in a bathtub and eat across from someone you love it's great it's a chill spot to come hang out not super work friendly if you're looking for a place to work but the prices are right the service is often pretty slow but otherwise like the environment is on point it's a lot of fun [Music] bucho wall is a fantastic park that actually was built unlike I think this is like a landfill originally Napoleon came in and cleaned it up there are two different bars here bar slash restaurants it's really fun to kind of wander around they're closed right now but if you wanted to come in you don't just have to picnic you could actually sit down and have a drink fantastic just a great big park lots of people lots of picnics we're gonna go out to the center though the centerpiece which you've just seen is like I don't know the crown jewel of the park system in Paris that might be quite I don't know if I can make that assertion but I'm going to just gonna own it so this is the best part of the whole city [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we've walked over to levy Nets which is a big park but also a combination of things like concert halls and event centers and there's a lot going on over here and it's at the very top of the canal you use the canal to go any farther north you actually leave Paris we're very close to the northern northern edge of Paris is about as far northeast you can get inside the city we're gonna walk through here a little bit you want to come up here see a show this is where I went to see Holiday on Ice once you want to see figure skating they'll be end up being up here at some point it's big kind of fantastic and we're still on the hunt for space meters I only need four to take the absolute lead but I'm really disappointed with how few we've seen on this walk so far so yeah and then lunch [Music] this is also where you'll find the Philharmonic if you want to come see a show there I've never been inside but I have walked up and around the structure it's all shiny and metal and fun there's a lot of stuff that goes on up here I don't even know what all happens here but I've been here for a handful of shows over the years and every time I'm here I feel like I should come back for more they also have leg on dad which I think used to be one of the really big markets here in the north of the city but now is I want to say it's an event center don't quote me I should probably look that up anyways I'm just happy to see that the fountains are finally back on it looks like we're using la grande al for exhibitions we've got the King Tut exhibition going on right now I don't know if he's actually inside but they have 150 original objects from his tomb in there so maybe he is hanging out in Lafayette it's a cool area to come wander around and there nothing else leads us back to Detroit but there are also a number of spots that I have on in my guide along the canal there's a couple of different spots for really good beer as well as some food and I've spent a lot of time on this section of the canal and I really really like it [Music] [Music] we're back to the top of the canal we started this morning we were at the bottom of this section the nineteenth portion of the canal we're gonna walk towards the middle which is we're gonna have lunch but you can see these boats I've always wanted to rent one of these boats I have yet to do it but you can actually rent these boats have a bachelorette party as these ladies are doing or just go for a you know brief stroll to my knowledge they actually booked up pretty far in advance so if you're gonna do it you want to try and get on the list early but like I said I've never done it before so I don't know what the full strategy is for that yet I'll try to get on top of that this summer just for my own personal enjoyment as much as anything but it's a really really nice stretch up here is that's a lot which is a fantastic Tap House that is in my guide and we're gonna stop just past it at Pan Am Brewing Company for lunch which makes some delicious beer but they also have some really good food and they're right on the canal it's gonna be quite the competition for a seating because being located where they are the outdoor seating fills up and stays full pretty much as soon as the Sun comes out for the entire summer so we'll see what we can get there and then that might be a wrap for the 19th it's a fun district highly recommended lots of really cool stuff going on here just happens if you oh we're gonna get coffee first to it forget about that so we'll get coffee on the way there's a new coffee spot that Bashan recommended to us we're gonna cross over get that and then we'll get lunch and yeah if you're gonna come to the 19th I would suggest you come you enjoy it but if you're not familiar with the city I wouldn't necessarily stay here until you're more familiar with the layout and the kind of where to stay where not to stay section it's cuz the 19th has some portions that a little bit less trustworthy but overall cool area [Music] I this is a new coffee shop before Sean recommended that I've never been here before a coffee bar give it a try before lunch give me some more caffeine [Music] and that my friends is the 19th there's a lot of excitement going on behind me over here we just had lunch at Pan Am Brewing Company which is one of my favorite spots on the canal and has a few very difficult to get a seat outside but the beer is good the food is good the weights can be a little bit long but definitely worth it and right next to it is where we started for coffee with petiole bacon oh one of the go upstairs to show you more didn't has no story I'm really tired it's time to go home and edit this I hope you had a wonderful time wandering the 19th with us got a flavour for the canal everything around us and Boots Tremont's seriously best parks so great obviously bright early tomorrow morning for day 20 the last day of my 20 and 20 here in Paris good net [Music] [Applause]
