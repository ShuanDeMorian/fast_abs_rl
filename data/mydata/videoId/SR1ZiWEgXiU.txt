 so I got a 1017 nobody's helping and I got to pick that up his littering is bad [Music] good morning and welcome to day 17 of my 20 in 2004 the 17th of Ronnie's month today which if you're wondering why is the Arc de Triomphe in Jays video for a third time it's because it's shared co-equal E between three irani spots more or less this roundabouts in the 8th the 16th and the 17th so what can you do the 17th is a little bit of a mystery if you're wondering what a 20 and 20 is you've 17 deef how do you not know this yet basically making a video per day in each or on his month there are 20 runners months in Paris 20 districts in Paris and that's uh you know the gist of it today's day 17 might as well start moving the 17th is a mild mystery to me of course because again this is not a lot in it and it's not one that I've spent a ton of time in I've spent some time in it and there are a couple parks that I really want to show you and it isn't up and coming around he's mom there's a lot of really cool stuff going and if you saw my video on the extension of line 14 you would have seen a little bit of the 17th and that it's very much being modernized they're building a lot of housing a lot of family housing and there is a coffee shop that I do know in the 17th unfortunately they are of course closed today great there's one other place in here somewhere that I went to once two years ago that I have never been able to find again so I don't know if they're in business still or not and in the spirit of trying to give Starbucks a fair shake because I'm trying not to be a total snob and they are my hometown brand are they sort of I mean they're home state brand at least let's give them one more try this morning we'll see how it goes because I need I need some coffee but we'll wait and find a random bakery at least for you know the snacks and the success they actually got my drink right this time she's good it's really really sweet I tend to think of Starbucks as like an occasional treat when you're looking for a caffeinated milkshake you know then I guess the trick done from here there's a park that I've never really seen before it's a long park that I don't know how to sit in the name of properly but I'll give it a try later I'm gonna practice it a couple times let's see what I come up with I'm gonna hit that thing up ride it all the way to the train lines skip across those and show you bets in yo and the park of Martin Luther King jr. which is an awesome name for a park and we'll see what we find a long way hopefully hopefully a bakery but I'm telling the line here they ate the run Eastmont is to my right I want to go left so we can go deeper into the 17th coming up there as a French woman just now how to say and she also was uncertain how exactly to pronounce this so hold on I bet hair will just say quickly and then no one will know we set it incorrectly that's my theory looks really nice I'm not sure how much wheeling I can get away with in here but we might give it a try it looks like this Park is also part of the Petit Jean sharp because there's a train station just ahead feels like it's right on the line I didn't look at the map ahead of time to know for sure but this stretches a really long ways it's a really narrow park that runs between the buildings that you see behind me for a long ways that way and this way so if you want to go see the hair the pizza piea know the booba know the promenade pet hair then come check it out I don't even know if I'm saying that right you know I'm saying it close enough we've seen it I want and there's no no bikes or anything allowed inside so I can't really I don't I'm gonna walk through this one smaller portion of it and then we'll head on over to Betsy [Music] looks like it turns back into an actual train line that station is still in SNCF station so hop on a train and ride through this delightful Valley of brick lovely some of this is starting to look like housing projects over here but to be honest these are kind of different enough that they don't like really bother me and a lot of it still feels very awesome inian seems like a nice chill neighborhood to be honest this if if you were to have a family and need to live somewhere in Paris the 17th does seem like a good place to do it increasingly so as well because they're doing a lot of development over new where we're going next which is batten Yola the apartments that they built to run there there's a lot of modern apartment buildings that they built recently and I think they sold out before they even broke ground it's a popular place to live right now finding housing in Paris so it's gonna take a look at that there's a new space invader that I'm pretty sure is over there that he posted on Instagram so I'm gonna go try to find that one and yeah just enjoy bouncing around on the wheel a little bit [Music] bonk aldini this bridge right here we were here not too long ago like I said to see the extension line 14 you want to see the northern extension of line 14 or at least where they're digging around you can see from the outside up here as well as a bunch of the new expansions and they're pretty species [Music] that's the stairwell we internet and over here is the lift we came up from you want to get the aerial view of the line 14 expansion video there it is [Applause] [Music] so this is Martin Luther King jr. Park it's really big goes for a long way this gets cut by some train lines I don't know if they've connected the two parts of it or not but we'll go in in a second don't worry but first I've already seen what I'm here for well brand new space invader [Music] all right now that that's been accomplished I can die a happy man the day is complete let's go check out Martin Luther King jr. Park we might go check out Batson yo which is a separate park just across the way they're really nice and then I think I'll just wander a little bit give you a little bit more of a taste of what the 17th looks and feels like but feel like you're getting a pretty good idea it's a mix of modern and old it's a good transition between the Osman Ian period to the present day [Music] unfortunately the foot bridge that goes over is closed Oh hold on that lady knows what's up there's a way up over there holy but then it's closed over there yeah where I really want to go is basically closed maybe maybe I'll try going up there this is a lot of walking with the wheel though [Music] well there's a little peek at Martin Luther King Park let's go see if we can't find the bets in yo park as well which is what this neighborhood is called and then I might have to just make our way all the way to the border with the 18th before we bounce on out of here I'm looking forward to exploring the 18th from our mom might be my overall favorite neighborhood in the entire city but we're not talking about Montmartre today we're talking about bat-signal and the 17th [Music] scratch that Batson Yolo is right next to Martin Luther King Park you can find it very easily on your own but we've made our way pretty far north and east there's a tiny little park over here that I want to check out but first of course I thought you know I just will double check that there are no space invaders over here I saw some overpasses and those erupted in hot spots so priorities I'm gonna look for those and I'm gonna swing around and we will check and see what this little park over here is all about behind me is the new Palais de justice so it's the new I do now that's where they're doing all of their major court cases nice big fancy skyscraper red on the edge of the city we are at the edge of Paris very literally at the edge of Paris known as the belly for the periphery it's what the big highway encircling the city is referred to as and it's how you know you've made it to the far reaches of Parisian life I haven't found any more space invaders up here I'm gonna bob and weave through these side streets and then check out that tiny part which hopefully isn't a total letdown and I should definitely be on the street because all this construction [Applause] [Music] oh I just have a thought there is Oh ambulance there is a really nice photo that we can get the you it's not of something that's in the 17th but you take it from the 17th it looks really nice as I recall let's go so I'm gonna go test that theory out right found one that is a really big one I very grateful that I was able to find at least one more in the 17th before crossing over into the 18th which I'm pretty sure is directly across the street from us right now right on the border I've actually never been this far north in the 17 I've never been to this section of the 17th / 18th before it's fun to explore a little bit I'm gonna try and weasel my way back down towards that photo that I was thinking about I was just inspired because I could see just the top of sacre coeur over one of the buildings like oh I think I know there's a great spot where we can get a photo I'm not a hundred percent sure it'll work out 100 percent sure it's in the 17th but I'll let you know when we get there and we can cheat a little bit just to try and get it but in the meantime I got to flash this invader and then yeah start weaseling south from here I've seen a lot of these little areas it's funny too because I'm a lot more familiar with the 17th then I gave myself credit for it it's fun to bounce around alright let's let's go find that photo [Music] I found that coffee shop that I've been trying to find for two years found them Gazette they're not even in the 17th they're on the board of their eggs they're across the street from the 17th in the 18th figures come on 17th killing me killing me all right well they'll get they'll get more options one of these days still haven't gotten to the shot yet I just I just needed to interrupt Mike clarify that I want to film over this side of the street the 18th and telling you is just it's awesome it's amazing I can't wait to get over there you can almost see it from here so if you head away from plasticky she along basically line two there's this really nice Boulevard that heads away the trees are gonna make this more challenging as well but we'll see if we can't get ourselves a shot from the main street on this side I can accomplish this I will feel like I've actually made it through the 17th for the day I also found us an invader that it wouldn't let me flash so that was a little bit frustrating well there you go I hope you've enjoyed this little wander through the 17th it's not exactly a neighborhood that I would suggest that you go to right away the first time you're ever in Paris but if you've been to Paris if you're familiar with the city it's not about a run to wander through definitely a much more residential area than not there are along Boulevard de Benton Yoga is what we were on at least for a little while there there are some pretty fun stores if you want to pop in it's a nice spot for a wander to find something a little bit more local I know I found a couple along the way and if you continue past Rome which is the metro stop they were passing right now crossing with the the major train lines here you might find another couple of those nice shots of sacre coeur but you're gonna want to make sure that you've got like a real a pretty solid lens you're gonna want a pretty long lens for that oh yeah seem getting even better I kind of want to keep I'm just gonna at least cross the street here I'll end it here hope you had a fun time I'll see you bright and early tomorrow morning for the 18th and Montmartre probably my favorite neighborhood in all of Paris yeah I think it's my favorite my all-time I'd loved I love it can't wait to share it with you tomorrow morning see for that [Music] [Applause]
