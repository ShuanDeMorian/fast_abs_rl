With its grand boulevards, friendly locals, and first class cuisine, this city really has it all!\nOne of the best bits about Paris is how close it is!\n\nParis is connected to London by the Eurostar. Trains depart from St Pancras International in London, stop off at Ebbsfleet International, and Ashford International in Kent along the way. Trains start running at 5.40am and run every 60 - 90 minutes until 8.00pm.\nYou\u2019ll need your passport and ticket ready to pass through airport style security and board the train. \nHowever you can two bags, and there\u2019s no weight restrictions to worry about! There\u2019s an onboard cafe that sells hot food and drinks, and modern trains even have wifi. All in all the journey takes about two and half hours. \nThe EuroStar arrives at Paris Gare Du Nord, from here you can take the metro or a taxi to your hotel. We\u2019ll have more on the Metro later!\nNow if you\u2019re flying in\u2026\nThere are routes from most airports in the UK, and a flight will take between 1 - 2 hours, you\u2019ll either land in Charles De Gaulle in the North East, or the Smaller Paris Orly in the South. \nTo get into the city from Charles De Gaulle airport, you can take Line B of the RER, trains take about 35 minutes to Paris Gare Du Nord, where you can find connections to the Metro and other public transport. \nFrom Orly Airport you can connect to Line B of the RER line as well. Although you\u2019ll need to take the Orly Val Shuttle Service from the airport to Antony train station first.\n\nHowever, both airports are served by Air France\u2019s transfer buses. There are two lines from Charles de Gaulle into the city, one from Paris Orly and a line that connects the two. \n\nAs with most cities we recommend getting around on foot, besides being eco-friendly, it\u2019s a great way to get a feel for the city. \nBut just bear in mind that Paris is big. Like, really big. A walk from the Eiffel Tower to Notre Dame will take about an hour. Fortunately, if you\u2019re strapped for time then there are lots of really good public transport links.\n\nThe subway system is split into the Metro and RER lines. Tickets will work across both so you can treat it as one big underground network. In our experience, it served a purpose which was to us around the city quickly. It\u2019s just not the cleanest. \n\nThe Metro has 16 lines, each with a different colour while the five RER lines are assigned the letters A, B, C, D and E. RER and Metro trains run every day from 6 am until half past midnight.\n\nAs for tickets a single will cost you \u20ac1.90, we brought a book of 10 for \u20ac14.50. Now there are weekly and monthly passes available, but in my opinion, they\u2019re just a faff! You need a Passport photo, and everything else, so I just say a book of ten is the way forward!\n\n....",

There are some way less expensive hosts for air bnb if not willing to be on any central arrondissement, which is quite possible due to metro/RER.
