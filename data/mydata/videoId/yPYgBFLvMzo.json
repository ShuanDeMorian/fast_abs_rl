From wandering through Roman ruins to devouring pizza, and climbing up lookout points to feasting on gelato, in this travel guide, we\u2019re going to share with you 20 things to do in Rome, Italy:\n\nWe reached Roscioli which was the best pizza in Rome. Pizzas are served by the weight and we sampled 7 different pizza slices.\n\nWe stopped at Largo di Torre Argentina an archaeological site home to four different temples containing parts of the portico of Pompey.\n\nIt was a short walk to the Pantheon, a former Roman temple turned church, which dates back to the year 125 AD. The Pantheon boasted the world\u2019s largest cupola up until the 15th century, and it is still the largest unreinforced concrete dome in existence to this day making it one of the greatest architectural achievements by the ancient Romans. \n\nIf you want to find the best gelato, look for colours that are muted with small batches.\n\nOne of the many things to do in Rome, was to visit the Trevi Fountain. This is the largest Baroque fountain in the city.\n\nRome\u2019s most famed attraction is the Colosseum and its surrounding ruins. We started our visit on Palatine Hill, the most central of Rome's seven hills. What visitors see today are the ruins of the Palace of Domitian, a 1st-century complex, which served as the main imperial palace for 300 years. We continued to the Roman Forum. This square was the centre of ancient Roman life, with government buildings, temples, and markets. We reached the Colosseum, which was the largest amphitheatre ever built and could hold an estimated 50,000 and 80,000 spectators. \n\nWalking through the Vatican Museum was more overwhelming than enjoyable. We visited Vatican City to climb St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for views of Rome.\n\nCastel Sant\u2019Angelo was commissioned by the Roman Emperor Hadrian as a mausoleum for himself and his family. \n\nVilla Borghese is the 3rd largest public park in Rome with gardens, villas, and ponds with views of the city overlooking Piazza del PO-polo, the people\u2019s square.\n\nThat concludes our tour of Rome showcasing the many things to do in Rome on your own trip.\n\nThis is part of our Travel in Italy video series showcasing Italian food, Italian culture and Italian cuisine.  \n\nMusic by DJ Quads: https://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads",

PETER&#39;S BASILICA WITHOUT HAVING TO WAIT IN LINE:  When you&#39;re inside the Sistine chapel follow the tour groups that exit out the door on the right.  They get to go straight into the basilica with out having to wait in any line.  The workers aren&#39;t checking whether or not you&#39;re part of the group.  Only catch is that you miss out on the last bit of the museum if you just follow the ppl not part of the tour groups which i didn&#39;t mind.  I also didn&#39;t know that it cost more to buy tickets online but we bought our tickets online for the Vatican museum and the Colosseum and I don&#39;t regret passing everyone in line LOL.  We didn&#39;t climb up the basilica but we opted to go down into the crypt where they had all the past popes laid to rest.  Couldn&#39;t believe some were only popes for a few days!!",

You also missed parks, like Doria Pamphili and Villa Borghese, you didn&#39;t see the Fountain of Aqua Paola and didn&#39;t see the magnificent view over the entire center of Rome from La Terrazza del Gianicolo, you never had a dinner in Testaccio trattories of which kept an authentic roman cuisine (and not the crappy one for tourists).
