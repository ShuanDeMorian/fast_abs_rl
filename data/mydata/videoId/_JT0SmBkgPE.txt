 I have a feeling that something important is happening today right now with me vlogging a 729 [Music] good morning it's Sunday and today is the world cup finals which is going to be kind of crazy we're gonna try to make sure it captures some whatever happens after that of course if the French lose there won't be a whole lot to capture but if they win I might not make it home so with that in mind I'm gonna go get some coffee and get some work done because you know I might as well die productive and then we'll see what happens after that [Music] Christian on tour fun to see bells are ringin it's Coffee time gotta respect the bells let's have coffee turns out that the match is at five o'clock tonight not 8 p.m. like all the others so my whole day everything shifted getting some work done I've got a fair amount of stuff done I'm just stalling cuz it got kind of hot there and also because I'm really hungry so I'm gonna go find some food and then try to keep working I guess until we watch the match because it was I don't know I have to watch the match absolutely the nice thing is that means that if it gets done sooner then I don't have to stay up super late dodging riots trying to get home and edit so that's benefit downside is wearing sandals and I don't really know that I want to be wearing sandals in the midst of all of this so what's figure out how this goes lunch first [Music] all right Richard and I are gonna try and snag a spot at the old alliance but you actually sit at a table hopefully you've reserved it if the place isn't already full of people it's currently 2:16 game time by the clock there's a chance that everywhere it's already packed but we'll find out I just want to be it's funny the thing that's actually making me a little bit more hesitant like I don't really want to do this as much is because does necessarily feel safe being in a crowd of people drinking alcohol watching the World Cup match mostly because there's a particular demographic of parisian finn that just likes to throw down at the drop of a hat so yeah we'll be fine Richard's gonna bring his kids so you know for if we're not gonna be fine then we're really not gonna be fine but well it'll be good anyways so this goes and I'll show you what happens after hey Gustav we're still the tables away it's just it's all standing room only right I'm not surprised [Music] grab a beer at the Lizard Lounge Chair just because get a beer before he goes back to kid duty oh my goodness this place is already full update from the inside it turns out that there were some stools free it snuck in the corner stuck in the corner anyways I'll be here for sure he might come back and trim you will find out will sail away hoping to get away and and then we'll watch the match together this hopefully the environment in here is a little bit less violent then story spices start falling for it [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] all right the game is finally about to start I have no idea like if anything will make sense from back here just gonna watch it probably can't show too much of an interest illegally but I you know you know what happened already before this even posted so hopefully hopefully goes well we'll find out myself like Mia she's the one that inspired [Music] [Applause] the exhaust over there going to win they don't win now [Applause] now you gotta survive the trip home is the trick I'm gonna try the live string this this goes maybe see this tomorrow that means that I survived for the walk home the job France way to win I got to make my way up to I think when they try and go see what's happening the champs elys√©es as I didn't want to go to the crowds after at Bastille Day this is gonna be even crazier so he's gonna try and see what happens [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is the madhouse [Applause] I tried to live stream there's no bandwidth left no I've seen at this point just straight up walking in volume this is gonna get crazy boys just rain clothes no shoes [Music] [Applause] [Music] it never ends have you seen this immediate home alive so that you know that it died [Music] -
