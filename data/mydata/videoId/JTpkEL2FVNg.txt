 it's bogging a 726 I think [Music] morning it's Thursday which makes today French Friday and if it's supposed to be washed on my videos it'll make sense you just watch a few more last week we did the five best croissants in Paris best croissants a lot of croissants around here similarly there are a lot of penisula why not find the best of those this might be a little bit more doable actually we might be able to find some of the at least the ones that are the most famous among a couple others my goal today is to find a handful around the city that are spread around the city so no matter where you are in Paris you should be able to find one and have one it'll be delicious even if you're staying somewhere where I'm not so my buddy alex is gonna join me and together we're gonna encircle the city with pano chocolat i'm going to try and let you know what we think of each one what the prices are how to find them there are links below to google maps locations of each of these as well as a couple bonus ones on my map stir if you wanted to go to my map store you have to be a $10 or nut patron do it but got all of them located on my master along with I think three extras and I'll just keep putting more as we go anyways so no further ado I'm meeting Alex up here at Toyota cafe with a nice little coffee shop down in the seventh gonna grab ourselves a good little coffee to go it'll make our way to our first panel [Music] first adventure of the day it's closed second uh-huh Alex went to the wrong one he's in the first I'm in the seventh right now so I'll just wait from to get here and hopefully I'll be open by the end in the meantime I find it's a place to buy like some fruit or something to get started on the right foot all right it capitalized on adventure number one hairy cover is the name I marked on one map stir you want to find them really friendly good fruit well I'm assuming smells amazing at least wait for Alex coffee and then we'll actually started the panel Chocolat portion and if you weren't into peaches yeah it's perfect found that one but this is Alex by the way tonight but charity cafe apparently is not opening despite everything online saying they opened now at least maybe he's sick I hope he's okay whatever is going on anyways around the corner to blue a leaf which is in the five best coffee shops video that I just made again it's not necessarily the best that's we're gonna get coffee we'll go go to the first time okay now we're on track we have coffee blue early you could check it out sometime Olivia's really nice guy [Music] [Music] or the Virgin's windmill Casey I'm not I'm not wasn't very flaky on the outside was kind of fluffy and chewy which might have been that it wasn't as freshly baked as I was hoping it was okay a year or 20 for it what do you think I thought the bread was good but they were skimping on the chocolate that's a good actually that's a really good yeah I didn't even get chocolate my first bite it was very light on the chocolate so but to see what round two looks like gratitude Bread and Roses next [Music] and click here kaiser on the map and that's where we went first so we're right near place vendôme we went to an Eric Kaiser for croissants in the five croissant video but at a different place somewhere else I thought we would try there's Eric geysers all over the city they're reputed to have the best everything we're gonna give them a try I [Music] get the chocolate good chocolate sour here that's we were just what he I don't you should take that take that piece definitely wait flaky on the outside fluffy buttery paste in and the chocolate is much better way better quality the last one felt like he's kind of like a frosting or chocolate frosting this is like a real bar of chocolate on it doesn't it's not fresh maybe is not as puffy earlier yeah I think of the chocolate itself is better be nicer it was like mmm so chocolates nicer but it's not as soft food expected it's good definitely takes first place out of the first two we have that pastry is so buttery [Music] hey now we're going to the one that I tried to go to before do Penta dizzy day which is rated as the best in Paris the best Penna Chocolat is it I don't know we're about to find out we'll let him be a judge but he's like less enthused because it's already been enough butter for him today no does he know he's got to eat two more so yeah we'll grab this it's a classy place in your rep who bleak so if you're in the area the rep you bleak is one of the best areas for food anyways in the city it's just around the corner and so we'll grab that it's also very close to the canal so if you need more coffee there's a good spot not far from here we get a hit on the way he's also you want some coffee and then yeah and then we'll bounce off to the next one [Music] first reaction I don't know it's really good boy what is that there's like something else in it texture-wise it's pretty amazing the flake who's really good pastry itself is like completely different yeah it's like it's not there it's just like heating air kind of wavy fluffy chocolates very good it's also a gyro a tea and it's a little bit smaller it has a very distinct flavor that's very different I don't know how to describe it very good worth it but I think I don't think it takes first place that you've ties if at best I don't know I think right now Eric guys was the best oh I think there cuz there's money right now don't kill me for saying that all right for any you want some coffee ok we're gonna go get him some coffee and then we'll carry on to the next [Music] just around the corner and across the canal is ten bells we're gonna go to ten bells which is familiarly tied to the front end of Belleville which is one of the coffee shops I showed you in the five best coffee shops video I know I'm talking a lot about five best everything today but it's one that we haven't been to in a while so we'll get him a coffee there and then we can get back on the piano chocolat trail actually i really liked your description how did you describe that the bread was like a delivery device for the chocolate it wasn't like it wasn't something of itself but you said it was like that it yeah it's kind of like a cookie I don't know if I'd call it I don't know if shortbreads exactly what the kind of cookie which is probably not the only thing they want to hear but I mean it was good but yeah it was weird that I yeah it was confusing like it's now that we're actually openly and intentionally judging this I feel very like unqualified so take it all of this with a grain of salt definitely try it take the greatest all that was a gyro a tea Eric Kaiser is 135 the first one the Virgin was 120 so we're getting more expensive right now and they've gotten smaller with each one 180 is pushing it on price that's kind of expensive for a pound of Chocolat but still I still worth it sufficient haha he apparently needs more caffeine and look at that just resounding excitement for the coffee all about it this Portuguese place right here is also really good get the chicken with little chicken pies they're amazing [Music] you know you're getting this down you know you're done hmm that's a winner out the gate the only downside I think is like it's a little bit chewy the pastries a little bit trim really really flaky tastes like a good buttery pastry the chocolate is really good it's delicious but it's not very fresh Oh mm-hmm I think the chewiness is a is a result of it having sat out for a little bit but this was number one yeah this is number I think this is definitely number one come get him first thing in the morning no and this is only a Euro 30 which puts it in the very reasonable range properly priced good and it's huge so yeah that's a winner we just missed the whole line there's like a lot of people for me no that's close all right and now on to was gonna head to Bread and Roses I know what's going on but you know no pain au chocolat they're out they do it in the morning and then again in the afternoon so we could come back at three o'clock you can't come back at three o'clock you can't guess I will come back at three o'clock so what time is it now oh my gosh okay well we'll figure this out anyways what out of the four that you had what is your favorite do you remember pink the last one we just had yeah that was bleh sucrée wasn't super fresh but if you come back come in the morning it was delicious I think that they were my favorite to bless you okay we'll give these guys a try though here as soon as hopefully Oh they've got like a cafe next door and everything too actually the nice thing is that it's right next to the gardens of Luxembourgers Oh Luxembourg Gardens there's a space meter over there that I feel like I have but I'm not sure so we'll see here in a second but I'll come back and check this out here and maybe we're just gonna go find lunch which might you know make my results a little bit more biased but I need real food so walk through the park and then we'll get back to that [Music] a couple hours later heading back just got a walkout I guess this is the westernmost exit pretty big you'll notice it and then on our way [Music] so it does have the unfair advantage of being fresh like it's still hot she told me like five times not to eat it yet because it's too hot however it has been a while it's the afternoon and I did have a really bad lunch so my stomach's already kind of like not sure about the world all in all I think it's a wash we'll just see how this tastes gonna go for it now hmm well Oh definite freshness unfair advantage cuz Wow that's where the good it was a Euro sixty your bread and roses mmm like flaky buttery not chewy definitely ties for first place with the other one if we take into effect that it's fresh other residues first place for sure I leave it up to you come to Paris or if you live here just try them all totally worth it and then just make sure you walk a lot between them to burn off the calories because it's a lot of pastry in one day whoo all right I got to go film is jean-yves now and pick up some kettle balls just arrived for me at the peloton so I've worked and errands to do and then maybe I'll just go to bed early again some exit did that last night and it was amazing not as amazing is this [Music] he's literally just doing this as a snack this is my this is a snack no closure Lisa that's why you should befriend famous chefs because then they break out all the stops when it comes to the snack time I love that guy who's needed to film one more thing for a little video I'm making for his website I just make him little videos here and there for fun because he's a friend and he makes macarons for me back home this is a homemade just fit that literally these just came out of the oven a few minutes ago handmade it for me he made me wanted to eat and I asked him if we could cut it in half so I could share it so I figured I'd take one to Paul because Paul is holding on to some stuff for me for mail and he just went ahead and made me another one for Paul so I ate the whole other one so I'm gonna deliver this to Paul and it looks a little bit silly but I'm just trying to keep it safe and then yeah thank you so much Shelly for sending those they're gonna be fantastic I definitely need to like work out some we're very happy to have them if you liked today's video please do make sure to you know express that somehow maybe just like when you're watching another video
