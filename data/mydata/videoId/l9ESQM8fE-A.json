They're great, and I genuinely had a really fun time on the photo shoot and was also really thrilled with the photos! Getting photos taken in Paris would be a great souvenir for any trip (load up your Instagram or Tinder profile on the go!) http://bit.ly/ElleAmPhotoshoot\n\nMore on their photo tours of Paris soon \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\udc4d\n\nMy name is Jay Swanson - I'm an American writer living in Paris on an artist visa and hoping to make the city of light my home base - at least for the foreseeable future.

Thanks! (The FTC wants me to tell you that up front)\n\nFAQ:\nHow long have you lived in France? On and off for over two years.\n\nWhat do you miss most about ho- NACHOS\n\nYou're always talking about living on some ship. WHAT SHIP? - I made a \"Draw My Life\" video that explains a lot here: https://youtu.be/-MrvL37jTKM\n\nWhere are you from originally? - Pullman, Washington - a small university/agricultural town near Idaho (and yes, the potatoes are amazing).\n\nWhat do you film with? - I've made a lot of changes recently, but I try to keep my gear list up to date if you want to see what I use and buy some for yourself: http://bit.ly/JaysGearList\n\nWhat do you edit with? - Adobe Premiere - it's pretty much all I've ever used since high school.\n\nAren't you ever freaked out by leaving your camera behind to film yourself? - Yep. But not too badly - I tend to be careful when I do.\n\nWhy are you living in #Paris? - Because I've always wanted to; I feel at home here: https://youtu.be/4Vivf6MqMxQ\n\nDo you speak French? Oui. https://youtu.be/va1QjaHgij8\n\nYou talk a lot about the books you're working on, what are they about? - They're sci-fi (and fantasy) and I've got a decent pitch for you here: https://youtu.be/W2bKt4_Tp4E\n\nDo you make money off YouTube? - Ha, no. I wish. It took me over 500 videos to make my first total $100 off adsense. I think it will slowly change, but VERY slowly.\n\nI really enjoy your videos, how can I support you? - The easiest and best way to support me is through Patreon, where you can pitch in as little as $1/mo to help me make better videos: http://patreon.com/jayswanson\n\nI don't trust this Patreon thing - can I just paypal you? - Here's my ko-fi if that's your thing (and coffee is your game): https://ko-fi.com/jayswanson\n\nBut I want to send you something tangible! - I do have a wishlist on Amazon, though it's a bit complicated with the international shipping situation. This is the US one: http://amzn.to/2ykS9Ux\n\nAnd here's the French wishlist: http://bit.ly/JaysFrenchWishList\n\nThanks for watching!",
