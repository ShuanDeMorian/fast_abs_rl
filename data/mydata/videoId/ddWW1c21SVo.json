Grab my guide to Paris here: http://bit.ly/ParisVloggersGuide for my recommendations on food, drinks, and coffee along the canal and around the 19th district of Paris.\n\nPatrons in the Wanderer category and up can also get access to my Mapstr which gets updated in real time: http://patreon.com/jayswanson and then find me on the internet in all of the usual spots:\n\nMore swag here:\nhttp://bit.ly/ShirtOfTheMonth (shirts and hat)\nhttp://bit.ly/JaysGearList (my gear and books)\nhttps://gum.co/camerafour (Disposable Camera Four digital scans)\n\nFollow me here:\nhttp://twitter.com/jayonaboat\nhttp://instagram.com/jayswanson\n\nMusic by: Dyalla\n\nThe 19th arrondissement of Paris is best known for Basin de la Villette and Parc des Buttes-Chaumont - a fantastic park in the northeast of Paris built by Napoleon III. While I wouldn't recommend staying here on your first visit to Paris (you can read why in my guide) I would definitely recommend a visit if you've got time.\n\nMy name is Jay Swanson - I'm an American writer living in Paris on an artist visa and hoping to make the city of light my home base - at least for the foreseeable future. I write science-fiction and fantasy, vlog daily, and love pizza a little too much.\n\nLinks below to Amazon are affiliate links - meaning if you click through them and buy something, I'll get some pennies. Thanks! (The FTC wants me to tell you that up front)\n\nFAQ:\nHow long have you lived in France? On and off for over two years.\n\nWhat do you miss most about ho- NACHOS\n\nYou're always talking about living on some ship. WHAT SHIP? - I made a \"Draw My Life\" video that explains a lot here: https://youtu.be/-MrvL37jTKM\n\nWhere are you from originally? - Pullman, Washington - a small university/agricultural town near Idaho (and yes, the potatoes are amazing).\n\nWhat do you film with? - I've made a lot of changes recently, but I try to keep my gear list up to date if you want to see what I use and buy some for yourself: http://bit.ly/JaysGearList\n\nWhat do you edit with? - Adobe Premiere - it's pretty much all I've ever used since high school.\n\nAren't you ever freaked out by leaving your camera behind to film yourself? - Yep. But not too badly - I tend to be careful when I do.\n\nWhy are you living in #Paris? - Because I've always wanted to; I feel at home here: https://youtu.be/4Vivf6MqMxQ\n\nDo you speak French? Oui. https://youtu.be/va1QjaHgij8\n\nYou talk a lot about the books you're working on, what are they about? - They're sci-fi (and fantasy) and I've got a decent pitch for you here: https://youtu.be/W2bKt4_Tp4E\n\nDo you make money off YouTube? - Ha, no. I wish. It took me over 500 videos to make my first total $100 off adsense. I think it will slowly change, but VERY slowly.\n\nI really enjoy your videos, how can I support you? - The easiest and best way to support me is through Patreon, where you can pitch in as little as $1/mo to help me make better videos: http://patreon.com/jayswanson\n\nI don't trust this Patreon thing - can I just paypal you? - Here's my ko-fi if that's your thing (and coffee is your game): https://ko-fi.com/jayswanson\n\nBut I want to send you something tangible! - I do have a wishlist on Amazon, though it's a bit complicated with the international shipping situation.

I loved staying in the 19th at an airbnb right next to Buttes Chaumont.  Your tips really helped, my goal was to not be that tourist.  No troubles on the  Metro or on escalators.  Did not dress like a tourist, so the scammers left me alone while they went after obvious tourists.  Only when my German friend visited me and was speaking English did we have the gold ring scam outside the D&#39;Orsay.   Only thing I did not account for is how warm and humid it was in Paris the week of 14/4/19.  Everyone was wearing coats and I was not wearing one at all.  As a suggestion, I would tell anyone visiting Paris not to take the open bus tour unless you want to spend all day in traffic.  Do your homework on what you want to see and take the Metro.  Only 5 days in Paris then spent the last 2 weeks in the Perigord.  While Paris is wonderful, there is so much more to see in France.",

I loved staying in the 19th at an airbnb right next to Buttes Chaumont.  Your tips really helped, my goal was to not be that tourist.  No troubles on the  Metro or on escalators.  Did not dress like a tourist, so the scammers left me alone while they went after obvious tourists.  Only when my German friend visited me and was speaking English did we have the gold ring scam outside the D'Orsay.
